/// End-to-end check of the three #851 defects on a real recording, through the
/// public API exactly as an integrator uses it. `minContextForConfirmation` is
/// set above the clip length so **no window ever confirms**, which is the state
/// every defect hid behind:
///
/// 1. terms built in code (`CustomVocabularyTerm(text:)`, no token IDs) must be
///    tokenized at configure time — asserted on the session's vocabulary;
/// 2. an unconfirmed window must still be rescored — asserted by every
///    unconfirmed update carrying a non-nil `ctcDetectedTerms`, which is set
///    only when rescoring ran for that window (#899);
/// 3. an unconfirmed window must not erase the previous window's volatile text —
///    asserted by the opening phrase surviving; with boosting on, `finish()`
///    builds from that text and returned "" before the fix.
///
/// Nothing here depends on the runner's acoustics. A CI runner's raw decode
/// already said "follow-up" on this clip, and a later run's spotter found no
/// "Codex" at all, so neither a text correction nor a detection is asserted;
/// detections are only logged.
///
/// Needs the Parakeet v3 and CTC models; runs when both are cached or
/// `FLUIDAUDIO_RUN_ASR_E2E=1` allows a download.
