/// Magpie is an encoder-decoder transformer that emits discrete NanoCodec tokens
/// autoregressively at 21.5 fps; NanoCodec then decodes them to 22 kHz audio. The
/// Swift port uses four CoreML models (text_encoder, decoder_prefill, decoder_step,
/// nanocodec_decoder) plus a small 1-layer "local transformer" implemented in Swift
/// to sample the 8 codebook tokens per step.
///
/// Usage:
/// ```swift
/// let manager = try await MagpieTtsManager.downloadAndCreate(
///     languages: [.english, .spanish])
/// let result = try await manager.synthesize(
///     text: "Hello from Magpie.", speaker: .john, language: .english)
/// ```
