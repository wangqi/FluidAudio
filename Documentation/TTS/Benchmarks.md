## Why not just RTFx?

RTFx (audio_seconds / synth_seconds) is a useful single number for batch
synthesis, but for conversational use it hides the things users actually
feel:

1. **Cold start** — first model load + ANE compile after install or
   reboot. On Apple Silicon the system's `anecompilerservice` can take
   tens of seconds on first invocation; subsequent loads finish in ~1 s.
2. **TTFT (time-to-first-audio)** — for streaming agents the question
   is "how long until the user hears *something*", not "how long until
   the whole utterance is rendered". For one-shot / batch backends in
   this slice `ttft_ms == synth_ms`. **PocketTTS** is wired through
   its streaming API (`synthesizeStreaming`), so its `ttft_ms` is
   honest first-frame latency.
3. **Per-stage compute units** — Kokoro ANE is a pipeline of
   7 graphs. Sometimes ANE is *slower per call* but more efficient.
   The "right" compute-unit choice differs per stage.
4. **Memory footprint** — drives whether a backend is mobile-viable.
5. **Quality** — RTFx alone tells you nothing about whether the model
   pronounced "Reykjavík" or "$1,234.56" correctly. We measure WER +
   CER via Parakeet roundtrip on a fixed English corpus; non-English
   backends run with `--skip-asr` for now.

## Methodology

### Corpus

All shipped corpora come from the **MiniMax Multilingual TTS Test
Set** (`MiniMaxAI/TTS-Multilingual-Test-Set` on Hugging Face,
CC-BY-SA-4.0). The fetched files land under
`Benchmarks/tts/corpus/minimax/<lang>.txt` (24 languages × 100 phrases
= 2400 phrases) and are gitignored — populate them on demand with
`swift run fluidaudio minimax-corpus`. Attribution, revision pin,
and WER caveats live in [`MinimaxCorpus.md`](MinimaxCorpus.md).

Reference each language as `--corpus minimax-<lang>`:

| Backend     | Default corpus     | Other supported MiniMax languages              |
|-------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Kokoro ANE  | `minimax-english` | `english` (`af_heart`); Kokoro ANE also ships `chinese` (`--variant mandarin`, voice `zf_001`) and `japanese` (`--variant japanese`, voice `jf_alpha`, built-in MeCab + Cutlet G2P; see footnote ᴶ) |
| PocketTTS   | `minimax-english`  | 6L packs: `english`, `german`, `italian`, `portuguese`, `spanish`. 24L packs: `french_24l`, `german_24l`, `italian_24l`, `portuguese_24l`, `spanish_24l` |
| StyleTTS2   | `minimax-english`  | `english` only (LibriTTS iteration_3, zero-shot from `--reference` audio) |
| Chatterbox (beta) | `minimax-english` | 18 of the 23 upstream languages via `--language` (zh/ja/he/ko/ru unported); built-in voice, macOS 15+ |
| Chatterbox Nano (beta) | `minimax-english` | `english` only; inline paralinguistic tags (`[laugh]`, `[chuckle]`, …); built-in voice, macOS 15+ |
| Supertonic-3 | `minimax-english` | 31 ISO codes minus `zh`: `english`, `korean`, `japanese`, `arabic`, `bulgarian`, `czech`, `danish`, `german`, `greek`, `spanish`, `estonian`, `finnish`, `french`, `hindi`, `croatian`, `hungarian`, `indonesian`, `italian`, `lithuanian`, `latvian`, `dutch`, `polish`, `portuguese`, `romanian`, `russian`, `slovak`, `slovenian`, `swedish`, `turkish`, `ukrainian`, `vietnamese`. Voice styling via `--voice-style <preset.json>` |

Lines beginning with `#` are comments. Custom corpora can still be
passed with `--corpus-path <file.txt>`.

### Metrics

Per phrase:
- `ttft_ms` — time-to-first-audio. The "first audio" granularity is
  backend-defined; see [Audio chunk window
  size](#audio-chunk-window-size) below for the per-backend numbers.
  **PocketTTS** is benchmarked through `synthesizeStreaming`, so its
  `ttft_ms` is the timestamp of the first 80 ms audio frame (1920
  samples @ 24 kHz) — actually-perceptible TTFA. **Kokoro ANE,
  StyleTTS2** are batch / one-shot (`synthesize(...)` returns
  the full waveform), so `ttft_ms == synth_ms == time-to-complete-wav`
  for those — interpret it as full-wav latency, not as TTFA.
- `synth_ms` — total synth wall time.
- `audio_ms` — generated audio duration.
- `rtfx` — `audio_ms / synth_ms`.
- `wer`, `cer` — via Parakeet ASR roundtrip on the rendered WAV.
- `stage_ms` — per-stage breakdown (backend-specific keys; populated
  for Kokoro ANE; empty for PocketTTS /
  StyleTTS2 / Supertonic-3 in this report).
- Backend-specific extras: `encoder_tokens`, `acoustic_frames`,
  `chunk_count`, `frame_count`, `code_count`, `generated_token_count`,
  etc.

Aggregates:
- `cold_start_s` — `manager.initialize()` wall time.
- `first_synth_ms` — first synth call after init (still cold-ish).
- `ttft_ms_p50` / `ttft_ms_p95`.
- `warm_synth_ms_p50` / `warm_synth_ms_p95`.
- `agg_rtfx` — `Σ audio_ms / Σ synth_ms` across the corpus.
- `peak_rss_mb` — process-wide peak resident set, via
  `task_vm_info_data_t.resident_size_peak`.
- Per-category macro WER / CER.

### Audio chunk window size

What counts as "first audio" is backend-defined. The vocoder /
codec emits in fixed-size chunks; only **PocketTTS** is wired to
yield those chunks incrementally on `main`. Everything else returns
the full waveform after the full pipeline runs, so `ttft_ms` for
those backends measures full-wav latency rather than perceptual
TTFA. The consolidated [per-backend table](#per-backend-top-line)
below carries the per-backend sample rate, chunk window, and
streaming flag inline alongside the performance metrics.

For batch backends, "average latency" the user perceives is
`synth_ms` (full wav) rather than `ttft_ms` — they're equal in
that case, so the consolidated table just reports them once.

### Reproducibility

```bash
# From the package root.
swift run fluidaudio tts-benchmark \
  --backend kokoro-ane \
  --corpus minimax-english \
  --voice af_heart \
  --compute-units default \
  --output-json bench.json \
  --audio-dir bench-wavs/

# Kokoro ANE Mandarin (skip Parakeet ASR; whisper CER scored separately).
swift run fluidaudio tts-benchmark \
  --backend kokoro-ane --variant mandarin --voice zf_001 \
  --corpus minimax-chinese --skip-asr \
  --output-json bench-zh.json --audio-dir bench-wavs-zh/

# StyleTTS2 zero-shot (LibriTTS iteration_3). The shipped ref_encoder
# is fixed at [1, 1, 80, 231], so the reference must be exactly
# 2.875 s @ 24 kHz mono. Trim externally before invoking, e.g.:
#   ffmpeg -i speaker.wav -t 2.875 -ar 24000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le ref.wav
swift run fluidaudio tts-benchmark \
  --backend styletts2 --reference ref.wav \
  --corpus minimax-english \
  --output-json bench-styletts2.json --audio-dir bench-wavs-styletts2/

# Supertonic-3 (multilingual, voice-style JSON). M1.json / F1.json / …
# ship under FluidInference/supertonic-3-coreml/assets/voice_styles/.
# `--lang` defaults are inferred from the corpus name; override with
# `--language <iso>` (e.g. ja, ko, fr). No `zh` — Mandarin is Kokoro ANE.
swift run fluidaudio tts-benchmark \
  --backend supertonic3 --voice-style M1.json \
  --corpus minimax-english \
  --output-json bench-supertonic3.json --audio-dir bench-wavs-sup3/
```

The harness writes a JSON report to `--output-json` and (optionally)
keeps WAVs under `--audio-dir`. Pass `--skip-asr` to drop the ASR
roundtrip. The default ASR backend is `parakeet` for English-only
runs; pass `--asr-backend cohere --cohere-model-dir <dir>` to score
Mandarin (or any of the 14 Cohere languages) against
[Cohere Transcribe](../../Sources/FluidAudio/ASR/Cohere/).

## Results

### Per-backend top-line

Reference machine: **Apple M5 Pro, 24 GB unified memory, on AC** —
Kokoro ANE rows re-measured on **macOS 26.6** (post-[#700][i700]),
PocketTTS and Supertonic-3 rows on macOS 26.5 (`25F71`). Only the **StyleTTS2** row is carried from the
prior **MacBook Air, Apple M2 (2022), 8-core CPU / 8-core GPU /
16-core Neural Engine, 16 GB, macOS 26** (`Mac14,2`) reference — it
does not run on the M5 host (missing `model.mil` in the shipped
bucketed BERT graphs — see footnote ˢ). All M5 rows use `--compute-units
default`; for Kokoro ANE that default is now the M5-safe routing (tail
iSTFT on GPU, RNN stages on ANE — see footnote ᴷ). 100 phrases per
language. Voices are backend defaults (`af_heart` for Kokoro ANE en,
`zf_001` for Kokoro ANE zh, `alba` for PocketTTS,
LibriTTS iteration_3 for StyleTTS2). English WER / CER via Parakeet
TDT roundtrip; Mandarin CER via `whisper-large-v3-turbo`.

One consolidated table per backend × language. **Basic info**
(license, language, footprint, sample rate, max chunk per pass,
streaming flag) is merged with **performance** (TTFT, synth, RTFx,
peak RSS, WER, CER) so there is a single source of truth.

ᴷ **Kokoro ANE on M5** runs on the **default** compute routing, which is
now the M5-safe placement: every stage on `.cpuAndNeuralEngine` **except
the tail (iSTFT) → `.cpuAndGPU`**. This is the only routing that runs on
M5 / macOS 26.5 — the *previous* default (prosody/noise/tail on `.all`)
crashed on the 2nd+ prediction in a process (`GPURNNOps … 'JIT not
supported'` on the prosody RNN on the GPU), and `all-ane`/`cpu-only`
crash in `libBNNS` (SIGSEGV) on the tail iSTFT. Keeping the RNN off the
GPU and the iSTFT off BNNS dodges both (the tail was always meant to run
fp32 on CPU/GPU — ANE rejects the exp/sin/iSTFT — so this is faithful,
not a hack). The old `.all` default ran fine on M2 but
its M2 perf under the new default is not re-verified here. The underlying
Apple bug is tracked in [#667][i667]; this routing is
`TtsComputeUnitPreset.default` / `.aneTailGpu`.

All three Kokoro ANE rows were **re-measured on macOS 26.6 after the
KokoroNoise v2 fix** ([#700][i700] — atan2 phase reconstruction,
removing the high-frequency sharpness of the v1 noise stage). The fix
is a step-change in ASR-measured quality: en WER 10.38% → **0.68%**
and CER 3.72% → **0.15%** (same Parakeet TDT roundtrip), zh CER
3.81% → **1.90%** (same whisper-large-v3-turbo methodology, see ‡).
Speed also improved across the board (en agg RTFx 28.7 → 31.0; the zh
row additionally picks up the Noise→GPU routing fix it predated:
TTFT p50 201 → 176 ms, agg RTFx 20.1 → 37.4).

ᶜ **Supertonic-3 (int4)** is measured on **M5 Pro / macOS 26.5** with
the default **int4 L-bucketed (ANE) VectorEstimator**. The int4-ANE
path drops per-phrase synth to ~80 ms vs the prior fp16-dynamic-on-CPU
path (5.55× on M2 — the speedup is the elimination of per-length
MPSGraph recompiles, not a chip effect). **WER 1.02% / CER 0.31%** —
restored to the M2 baseline (~0.84% / 0.3%) by the chunker fix in
[#669][i669]: the model degrades as a chunk approaches the 110-char /
128-token window (a 105-char *single* chunk scored 17.6% WER; a 71-char
chunk scored 0%), so `maxChunkLengthLatin` was lowered 110 → 70, keeping
every chunk in the clean regime. This cost ~20% RTFx (118× → 94×) but
cut macro WER from 6.86% to 1.02% — and confirmed the earlier "6.86%"
was chunk length, **not** an M2→M5 regression and **not** the int4
quantization (fp16/int8/int6 all scored the same 6–7% band at maxLen
110).

\* TTFT for **PocketTTS** is first-frame emit through the streaming
API (perceptual TTFA). **Kokoro ANE / StyleTTS2** both run
one-shot per phrase (no streaming yield on `main`), so for those
rows `ttft_ms == synth_ms == time-to-complete-wav`.

‡ Kokoro ANE Mandarin CER measured on the **full 100-phrase**
`minimax-chinese` corpus via `mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo`
against the WAVs rendered by `tts-benchmark --backend kokoro-ane
--variant mandarin --voice zf_001 --corpus minimax-chinese --skip-asr
--audio-dir …`: **macro CER 1.90% (M5 Pro / macOS 26.6, post-#700)**,
down from 3.81% pre-fix. Hypothesis and reference are NFKC-folded,
punctuation/whitespace-stripped, and **converted traditional →
simplified (`zhconv`) before scoring** — whisper freely emits
traditional script, which is an orthography difference, not a TTS
error (unnormalized it reads 6.19%). WER is omitted because Mandarin
has no word boundaries and `WERCalculator` splits on whitespace —
word-level WER reads near 100% and is meaningless.

ᴶ **Kokoro ANE Japanese** (`jf_alpha`, ANE-ja bundle) now accepts plain
Japanese through its in-process MeCab + Cutlet frontend (#914). The historical quality number
below used the `--phonemes` G2P bypass: the 100-phrase `minimax-japanese`
corpus was phonemized offline with
[`misaki[ja]`](https://github.com/hexgrad/misaki) (the same G2P
upstream Kokoro uses for `jf_*`/`jm_*` voices) into
`ipa_phonemes|reference_text` lines, synthesis feeds the IPA, and
quality scores against the reference text. CER via
`whisper-large-v3-turbo` on **kana readings** (both sides converted
with `pykakasi` after NFKC + punctuation strip): **macro CER 1.51%**.
Raw character CER reads 4.24%, but the gap is orthographic variance
(whisper writing 頑張って where the corpus has がんばって, 私 vs
わたくし), not pronunciation error — the reading-level number is the
faithful one, mirroring the trad→simp normalization for zh. WER n/a
for the same no-word-boundary reason as zh.

¶ StyleTTS2 footprint is the sum of the shipped iteration_3 mlpackages
(text encoder + bert + ref_encoder + post_albert + alignment + prosody
+ noise + decoder + tail). The shipped ref_encoder is exported with
a fixed `[1, 1, 80, 231]` mel shape, so reference audio must be
exactly 2.875 s @ 24 kHz (300-hop). The benchmark harness expects
the caller to trim externally; mismatched durations error out at
predict time.

ˢ **StyleTTS2 (M2)** — numbers carried from the M2 reference. StyleTTS2
**cannot be re-baselined on M5** with the current assets: the shipped
length-bucketed BERT graphs (`bert_fp16_t64`, `bert_fp16_t128`,
`bert_fp16_t256`) are missing `model.mil` (only `weights` + metadata
present), so CoreML fails with `corruptedModel … Error in reading the
MIL network`. Only the base `bert_fp16.mlmodelc` is intact. This is a
broken upstream asset (re-download does not help), not an M5 issue.
Tracked in [#668][i668]; re-baseline once the bucketed `model.mil`
files are re-uploaded.

### Kokoro ANE — per-stage breakdown (default preset, MiniMax-English)

Means across 100 `minimax-english` phrases on M2 (`af_heart`,
post-laishere 7-graph chain, `default` preset). On M5 / macOS 26.5 the
main table uses the `ane-tail-gpu` preset (tail iSTFT on GPU instead of
the default routing — see footnote ᴷ), so the per-stage split there
differs. Stages map to the 7-CoreML-graph split documented in
[KokoroAne.md](KokoroAne.md). Vocoder + noise together
account for ~90% of synth time, which is the natural target for any
further per-stage compute-unit re-tuning.

| Stage         | Mean ms | % of total |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| `albert`      |   24.5  |  2.5%      |
| `post_albert` |    9.3  |  1.0%      |
| `alignment`   |    1.4  |  0.1%      |
| `prosody`     |   40.0  |  4.1%      |
| `noise`       |  169.3  | 17.5%      |
| `vocoder`     |  704.4  | 72.9%      |
| `tail`        |   17.0  |  1.8%      |
| **total**     |  965.9  | 100%       |

### Supertonic-3 — per-language breakdown (M2, default preset, `M1` voice)

Same harness, same `M1.json` voice style, same default
(`--total-steps 8 --speed 1.05 --compute-units default`). All 10
languages complete the full 100-phrase `minimax-<lang>` run.

> **Note (M2 vs M5):** this breakdown is the **M2** run at the old
> 110-char chunk cap. On **M5 Pro / macOS 26.5** with the int4 default
> and the [#669][i669] chunker fix (`maxChunkLengthLatin` 110 → 70),
> English scores **WER 1.02% / CER 0.31%** — in line with the 0.84% /
> 0.32% here. The per-language non-English rows below have **not** been
> re-measured with the shorter chunk cap; expect a similar improvement
> on the longer-phrase languages.

WER / CER for English is from the in-process Parakeet TDT
roundtrip. The nine non-English rows were synthesized with
`--skip-asr` (Parakeet is English-only), then scored offline by
transcribing the saved WAVs with **`mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo`**
and computing WER / CER against the corpus references with
`jiwer` after NFKC + lowercase + punctuation-strip normalization.
Peak RSS is process-wide so the English row is inflated by the
additional Parakeet models held in memory; the nine non-English
rows reflect Supertonic-3 in isolation.

| Language        | Code | Synth p50 / p95   | Agg RTFx | Peak RSS | WER†    | CER†   |
|-----------------|------|-------------------|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| English         | en   | **479 / 6491 ms** | 5.55×    | 679 MB‡  | 0.84%   | 0.32%  |
| Arabic          | ar   | 427 / 5827 ms     | 6.76×    | 396 MB   | 3.81%   | 1.16%  |
| French          | fr   | 926 / 5897 ms     | 5.58×    | 292 MB   | 3.32%   | 1.13%  |

| Korean          | ko   | 438 / 1599 ms     | **11.36×** | 370 MB | 11.54%§ | 4.23%  |
| Russian         | ru   | **321 / 6563 ms** | 7.97×    | 356 MB   | 4.06%   | 1.30%  |
| Spanish         | es   | **354 / 583 ms**  | **15.90×** | 351 MB | 1.28%   | 0.57%  |
| Vietnamese      | vi   | 776 / 3934 ms     | 7.02×    | 440 MB   | 9.60%   | 8.33%  |

† Non-English WER / CER produced offline with
`mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo` against the saved WAVs;
text normalized (NFKC + lowercase + punctuation strip) before
scoring. English uses the in-process Parakeet TDT roundtrip.

‡ English row includes Parakeet TDT loaded in-process for the
ASR roundtrip; the other nine rows ran with `--skip-asr` so the
RSS column reflects only the four Supertonic-3 graphs + indexer.

§ Japanese / Korean have no whitespace word boundaries; `jiwer.wer`
splits on whitespace, so the Japanese WER is meaningless (CER 9.3%
is the right metric). Korean's WER is borderline meaningful because
the corpus uses spaced words.

### About the WER / CER numbers

The MiniMax corpus mixes short conversational phrases, medium news
headlines, and long narrative paragraphs. WER on the long tail is
sensitive to the ASR + text-normalizer stack (e.g. `"3,5%"` →
`"three point five percent"` vs. `"three and a half percent"`); per
the [upstream community
discussion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MiniMaxAI/TTS-Multilingual-Test-Set/discussions/10),
absolute WER is best read **relatively** (backend A vs. backend B on
the same corpus + same ASR + same normalizer) rather than against
raw paper numbers.
