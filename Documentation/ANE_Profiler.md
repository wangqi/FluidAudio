# Computer-use decision models

Measured separately on September 19, 2026: Apple M5 Pro, 24 GB, macOS 27.0.
CUA-S1-FORMS uses real text inputs, not audio. With `.cpuAndNeuralEngine`, its
plan assigns 149 operations to ANE and 24 to CPU; `.all` selects 173 GPU operations.

| Model | ANE ops | GPU ops | CPU ops | Portable size | Warm model call |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| CUA-S1-FORMS (`.cpuAndNeuralEngine`) | 149 (86.1%) | 0 | 24 (13.9%) | 1.51 MB | p50 0.929 ms / p95 0.973 ms |
| CUA-S1-FORMS `ane-gather` (optional) | 162 (98.2%) | 0 | 3 (1.8%) | ~1.51 MB | paired p50 0.970 ms / p95 0.988 ms |

Timing uses 30 Python Core ML calls over three real form inputs after warmup,
excluding encoding and UI work. Counts are scheduler assignments, not measured
runtime shares. See [the conversion toolkit](https://github.com/FluidInference/mobius/tree/codex/cua-s1-forms/models/computer-use/cua-s1-forms/coreml#device-placement) for the
four-policy comparison, load timings, fallback reasons, protocol, and raw report.
The optional unsigned-gather variant leaves only three input casts on CPU. Its
matched ABBA comparison used 60 calls per model and measured 0.915 ms for the
default versus 0.970 ms for `ane-gather`; more ANE placement was about 6% slower.
The default artifact is retained. No utilization or energy saving was measured.

production it runs on GPU, not ANE. The table shows ANE *capability* with the default config.

**Component detail**

### Parakeet TDT v3
Latency here is **measured on real audio** (7.8 s clip, production config, 5-run average), not synthetic.

| Component | ANE | GPU | CPU | ops | Size | Lat ms |
|-----------|----:|----:|----:|----:|-----:|-------:|
| Encoder | 99% | 0% | 1% | 1385 | 426 MB | 28.2 / chunk |
| Decoder | 0% | 0% | 100% | 24 | 23 MB | 9 ms (40× @ 0.23) |
| Joint | 0% | 0% | 100% | 24 | 13 MB | 23 ms (49× @ 0.46) |
| Preprocessor | 0% | 0% | 100% | 51 | 1 MB | 3.2 / chunk |

> Per 7.8 s of audio: 1 encoder call, ~40 decoder + ~49 joint steps. The joint loop totals ~22 ms,
> rivaling the single 28 ms encoder call.

### Parakeet TDT Japanese
Lat is **synthetic** (zero-input), not real audio (no CLI transcribe path). Runs ~2x low; treat as a
lower bound.

| Component | ANE | GPU | CPU | ops | Size | Lat ms |
|-----------|----:|----:|----:|----:|-----:|-------:|
| Encoder | 99% | 0% | 1% | 1386 | 580 MB | 23.3 |

> `CtcDecoder` lands on ANE despite being tiny (7 MB), the exception to the rule that small models stay

### Parakeet CTC Chinese
Lat is **synthetic** (zero-input), not real audio; the zh CTC pipeline uses a separate manager not
yet instrumented. Runs ~2x low; treat as a lower bound.

| Component | ANE | GPU | CPU | ops | Size | Lat ms |
|-----------|----:|----:|----:|----:|-----:|-------:|
| Encoder fp32 | 99% | 0% | 1% | 1385 | 1130 MB | 24.2 |

| Preprocessor | 0% | 0% | 100% | 52 | 1 MB | 0.95 |

### Parakeet CTC 110M
Lat is **synthetic** (zero-input); this is the keyword-spotting CTC variant with no transcribe CLI.
Runs ~2x low; treat as a lower bound.

| Component | ANE | GPU | CPU | ops | Size | Lat ms |
|-----------|----:|----:|----:|----:|-----:|-------:|

| MelSpectrogram | 0% | 0% | 100% | 32 | 1 MB | 0.57 |

### Parakeet EOU (1280ms)
Latency **measured on real audio**, warm (the device-split/size columns are the 1280ms bundle; the Lat
column was run on the **160ms** default CLI variant, so the encoder figure is that variant's).

| Component | ANE | GPU | CPU | ops | Size | Lat ms |
|-----------|----:|----:|----:|----:|-----:|-------:|
| streaming_encoder | 97% | 0% | 3% | 1174 | 220 MB | 6.5 / chunk |
| decoder | 0% | 0% | 100% | 14 | 8 MB | 30 ms (229× @ 0.13) |
| joint_decision | 0% | 0% | 100% | 21 | 3 MB | 28 ms (229× @ 0.12) |

> EOU doesn't ship a CoreML `preprocessor`. It computes mel features in native Swift
> (`AudioMelSpectrogram`), so there's no preprocessor row. (Nemotron, by contrast, *does* run its
> CoreML preprocessor.) decoder/joint go through the shared `RnntDecoder` (~229 steps for 7.8 s audio).

### Nemotron EN
Latency **measured on real audio**, warm (default 1120ms chunk, 7 chunks for 7.8 s). Uses the separate
decoder then joint path.

| Component | ANE | GPU | CPU | ops | Size | Lat ms |
|-----------|----:|----:|----:|----:|-----:|-------:|
| encoder_int8 | 97% | 0% | 3% | 1672 | 564 MB | ~13 / chunk (1st ~290 cold) |
| preprocessor | 0% | 0% | 100% | 47 | 1 MB | 2.4 / chunk |
| decoder | 0% | 0% | 100% | 24 | 15 MB | 44 ms (148× @ 0.30) |
| joint | 0% | 0% | 100% | 12 | 4 MB | 23 ms (148× @ 0.15) |

### Nemotron Multilingual
Latency **measured on real audio**, warm (2240ms chunk, 4 chunks for 7.8 s). Default decode is the
fused `decoder_joint` (B1).

| Component | ANE | GPU | CPU | ops | Size | Lat ms |
|-----------|----:|----:|----:|----:|-----:|-------:|
| encoder | 96% | 0% | 4% | 1680 | 540 MB | 9.7 / chunk |
| preprocessor | 0% | 0% | 100% | 47 | 1 MB | 1.9 / chunk |
| decoder_joint | 54% | 0% | 46% | 28 | 47 MB | 79 ms (168× @ 0.47) |
| joint | 100% | 0% | 0% | 12 | 19 MB | unused (B1 default) |
| decoder | 0% | 0% | 100% | 19 | 29 MB | unused (B1 default) |

> Unlike EN, the multilingual `joint` is fully ANE and `decoder_joint` is mixed (54% ANE).

# Diarization (streaming)

Compute plan (`Scripts/ane_profile.swift`, `--units all`) plus **warm per-call latency on real audio**
(NVIDIA's 97.6 s 8-voice demo clip, M5 Pro, macOS 26.7; Nemotron via `nemotron3-diarize --profile`,
Sortformer derived from wall RTFx over its 203 calls, so it includes host time and the cold first call).
Both models are pure forward passes over `[speaker cache | FIFO | chunk]`; `T` is that packed length.

\* `MLComputePlan` reports the placement CoreML *intends*; Nemotron 3 `offline` (3040 mel frames) fails
`ANECCompile` at runtime and silently runs on the GPU. Chunk mel input ≤ 1376 frames compiles for the
ANE; 1440+ does not. The split-graph presets bypass the cliff (host does feature stacking + the
1024→512 projection).

**Reading the table**

- Sortformer's 2% CPU residue and Nemotron's 2% are index/gather ops around the state packing; the
  split-graph variants move that packing to the host and leave a pure-fp transformer that is 100% ANE.
- **Per-call cost scales with `T`, not with audio advanced.** Nemotron `low` (T=541) costs 2.2× Sortformer
  fast (T=242) per call on the ANE and advances 1.5× the audio; at 1.04 s latency the two are within 1.5×
  of each other per audio-second. Bigger Nemotron chunks amortize the fixed state: fast32 is 8× cheaper
  than `low` per audio-second at higher DER-neutral latency, fast128 19× cheaper.
- **The M5 Pro GPU beats the ANE at 1.04 s latency for both models** (Nemotron `low` 12.0 vs 27.1 ms,
  Sortformer fast 10.4 vs 12.5) — ANE tiling of these packed sequences is unfavourable — while the ANE
  wins for fast128 (20.6 vs 37.0). `.all` picks per-op, not
  per-model, so choose the route explicitly for `low` on Macs; on iPhone the ANE is the only fast route.
- Sortformer's first GPU run on a fresh process paid a ~2.4 s cold compile on call 1 (whole-clip RTFx
  22× instead of 46×); the table's GPU figure is the warm second run. Its ANE cold cost is small.
  Nemotron's cold ANE compile is ~1 s for the monolithic presets.
- Sequence length is the cost: zero-shot layer drops, W8A8 on the monolithic graph, batch>1 on the ANE
  and speaker-cache/FIFO shrinking were all measured and rejected (see the Nemotron 3 conversion notes);
  the remaining lever is reusing the static state's attention across speaker-cache updates, untested.

### Pyannote offline
Latency **measured on real audio**, warm (`process --mode offline`, 7.8 s clip). Cold first-call is far
higher (see warmup note below): segmentation was 1293 ms and embedding 410 ms/call on the cold run.

> Warm segmentation (55 ms) is the heaviest stage and is 100% CPU. The **cold-start penalty is the real

# TTS

### PocketTTS (v2.1)
Autoregressive: stages run many steps per utterance. Measured on M-series /
macOS 26 with the v2.1 optimized packs. Only the fused flow decoder reaches the
ANE; flowlm/cond run on GPU (the rank-5 KV-cache `scatter` is rejected by the
ANE compiler at **any** precision), and mimi is CPU (fp16 streaming-state
feedback produces audible artifacts on the ANE, and it is compute-bound anyway).

| Component | ANE | GPU | CPU | ops | Size | Lat ms |
|-----------|----:|----:|----:|----:|-----:|-------:|
| cond_prefill | 0% | 100% | 0% | 550¹ | 127 MB | ~5 ms (1× @ 4.8) |
| flowlm_step (fp16) | 0% | 100% | 0% | 556 | 145 MB | 149 ms (43× @ 3.46) |
| flow_decoder_fused | **100%** | 0% | 0% | 1252 | 18 MB | 46 ms (42× @ 1.09) |
| mimi_decoder | 0% | 0% | 100% | 271¹ | 41 MB | 302 ms (42× @ 7.2) |

¹ `MLComputePlan` crashes on `cond_prefill` (ANE compile) and `mimi_decoder`
(streaming state), so their device split is inferred from the runtime config
(GPU / CPU) and the op counts are from `model.mil` (non-const ops, the same
metric MLComputePlan reports — verified equal on the fused decoder: 1252).

> v2.1 cut the per-utterance pipeline ~905 ms → ~452–520 ms (**~1.8× RTFx**),
> device-verified end-to-end (Whisper exact). Wins: **fused flow decoder** — the
> 8-step LSD Euler loop unrolled into one call (336→42 dispatches/utt), and the
> fat scatter-free fp16 graph flips **0% → 100% ANE** (the single-step kernel was
> always rejected); **cond_prefill** — whole conditioning block in one call
> (18→1); **fp16 flowlm**. The earlier "flowlm 1.97× on ANE" claim did **not**
> reproduce — flowlm is GPU. mimi is the remaining floor (~60% of wall-time),
> compute-bound (not overhead-bound — an MLState micro-bench showed state
> marshalling is only ~0.5 ms/call). Voice cloning uses the unchanged v2
> `mimi_encoder` (repo-root, language-agnostic; still crashes
> `MLComputePlan.load`) — not part of the v2.1 synthesis path.

### Supertonic
`VectorEstimator` runs once per denoising step (default 8) and is the heaviest stage. The **default is
now the fixed-length int4 (L-bucketed) build** (`.aneBucketed(.int4)`): ~94% on the ANE, ~2.7× faster
end-to-end, with 4-bit k-means palettization that is perceptually clean. The synthesizer pads each
chunk's latent up to the smallest bucket ≥ its length (L ∈ {128, 256, 512}; 128 covers the common
case). The legacy **fp16 dynamic** build (`--ve-variant fp16`) uses RangeDim shapes Core ML **cannot
place on the ANE**, so it stays on CPU; the `ANECCompile() FAILED` line it emits is non-fatal noise.
Verified M5 Pro / macOS 26.5; see [Supertonic3 docs](TTS/Supertonic3.md#vectorestimator-variants).

| Component | ANE | GPU | CPU | ops | Size | Lat ms |

² Fixed-build split + per-step latency from `MLComputePlan` + warm CPU-vs-NE timing at L128 (NE 3.8 ms
vs CPU-only 14.2 ms/step). A cold first call additionally pays a one-time ANE compile.

## How to measure

### Method 1: `MLComputePlan` (device split, what produced this report)

`MLComputePlan` (macOS 14.4+ / iOS 17.4+) loads a compiled model and reports, per operation, the
compute device CoreML will prefer. Counting ops by device gives the ANE/GPU/CPU split with no Xcode
and no instrumentation. Implemented in [`Scripts/ane_profile.swift`](../Scripts/ane_profile.swift);
the core is:

```swift
let plan = try await MLComputePlan.load(contentsOf: url, configuration: config)
// walk plan.modelStructure (.program ops / .neuralNetwork layers / .pipeline submodels),
// call plan.deviceUsage(for: op)?.preferred, and tally .neuralEngine / .gpu / .cpu
```

Reproduce the device split:

```bash
swiftc -O -target arm64-apple-macos14.4 Scripts/ane_profile.swift -o /tmp/ane_profile
/tmp/ane_profile path/to/Encoder.mlmodelc                # multiple args print a TOTAL
/tmp/ane_profile --units gpu path/to/Encoder.mlmodelc    # force a compute-unit policy
```

### Latency (one-time, real audio)

The latency numbers were a **one-time measurement**: temporary env-gated timers wrapped each model's
`prediction` call while running the real pipelines on a real benchmark clip (`transcribe`,
`nemotron-transcribe`, `parakeet-eou`, `process --mode offline`, `tts`). That instrumentation was
removed after measuring (not retained in the codebase). To refresh, re-add a timer around the
prediction sites in the relevant manager and re-run.

> **Warm vs cold matters a lot.** The first call to each model pays ANE compile + weight residency,
> which can be 10-50x the warm per-call cost (Pyannote segmentation: 1293 ms cold, 55 ms warm). The
> doc's numbers are warm (second run). Many-call stages (encoders, decode loops) amortize this;
> few-call stages (diarization) are dominated by it, so cold start is the real cost on a fresh launch.

### Method 2: Xcode Core ML Performance Report

Open the `.mlpackage`/`.mlmodelc` in Xcode → **Performance** tab → **+** → pick a connected device.
Per-layer Neural Engine / GPU / CPU breakdown on real hardware. Best for *which* layers fall off the
ANE and for per-device numbers (iPhone ANE differs from M-series). GUI only, not automatable.

### Method 3: `powermetrics` (runtime confirmation)

Methods 1 and 2 show the plan; this shows what the silicon actually did:

```bash
sudo powermetrics --samplers ane_power -i 200   # watch ANE power while inference runs
```

If ANE power stays near 0 mW during transcription, the model is not really on the ANE regardless of
config.

## Gotchas that knock work off the ANE

- **Small graphs (under ~50 MB)** stay on CPU by design; transfer overhead beats the speedup. Not a bug.
- **fp16 only.** fp32 ops fall to CPU/GPU (and watch fp16 **NaN** on some encoders).
- **Dynamic shapes / big reshapes** land on CPU; static-shape graphs stay on ANE. Cohere's v2 decoder
  fixed its attention mask to a literal shape specifically to stay ANE-resident.
- **`MLState` is ANE-incompatible on iOS 18** for some configs; stateful decoders can get bumped off.
- **ANE means fast inference, slow load.** First ANE init is multi-second; a model can be 90% ANE and
  still feel slow cold. That's load, not inference. Separate the two.
- **GPU sometimes wins.** Parakeet v3's encoder is deliberately on GPU (+8% RTFx, WER-neutral on
  M-series). "More ANE" is the goal for **iOS power**, not automatically for Mac throughput.
- **Optimization hints can backfire.** `MLOptimizationHints(reshapeFrequency: .infrequent,
  specializationStrategy: .fastPrediction)` regressed RTFx 26% on a static-shape encoder. Re-bench
  before enabling. See `Sources/FluidAudio/Shared/MLModelConfigurationUtils.swift`.

## Why convolutions map cleanly to the ANE and attention needs reformulation

The gotchas above share a cause: convolutions arrive in the shape and layout the ANE compiler wants,
and attention does not. That is why conv-heavy audio models in this repo profile at 93–100% ANE while
transformer stacks split, fall back, or deliberately ship on GPU. It is not a ceiling on transformers —
Apple's own ANE-optimized Transformer reaches up to 10× lower latency than the baseline graph (see
[Deploying Transformers on the Apple Neural Engine](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/neural-engine-transformers))
— but that speedup is earned by rewriting the graph, and stock attention does not get it for free.

**What Apple documents.** The ANE deployment guidance is explicit about four things: use a
channels-first 4D layout (`(B, C, 1, S)`), keep intermediate tensors small enough to stay
cache-resident (chunk large ones), avoid memory copies such as transposes and reshapes, and expect
small-batch inference to be bandwidth-bound rather than compute-bound. A convolution satisfies all four
as written: static shapes, channels-first activations, no layout change between layers, and a weight
tensor that is reused at every spatial position, so arithmetic intensity is high. Kokoro's conv vocoder
(99% ANE) and the WeSpeaker embedding (93%) are the canonical wins. Whether the silicon is literally
weight-stationary or holds activations in local SRAM is not something Apple documents or these
measurements can show; the documented guidance and the measured placement are enough to explain the
splits.

**Where stock attention diverges from that guidance:**

- **Two activations, no weight.** `QKᵀ` and `attn×V` multiply two runtime tensors. Whatever weight
  reuse the hardware exploits for convs does not apply, and at speech sequence lengths both matmuls sit
  in the bandwidth-bound regime Apple calls out.
- **Layout and transposes.** The transformer-native `(batch, seq, dim)` layout must be reformulated to
  `(B, C, 1, S)` with projections expressed as 1×1 convs (Apple's `ane_transformers` recipe). The
  distinction from GPU is one of graph lowering: GPU matmul libraries usually absorb a `Kᵀ` into strides
  or fuse it into the consuming kernel, so nothing is materialized, whereas the ANE compiler treats a
  transpose as a copy the guidance tells you to design out. A materialized transpose is data movement on
  either device.
- **Softmax is a reduction.** Low arithmetic intensity between two matmuls; in the bandwidth-bound
  regime it costs time without feeding the MACs. (Whether the ANE overlaps it with matmul work is not
  documented — treat "stalls the pipeline" as a hypothesis.)
- **S×S grows past cache residency.** The attention matrix grows quadratically with sequence length,
  which is exactly the intermediate tensor Apple's chunking principle targets. The sliding-window
  encoders here bound S with static 15 s chunks and place 93–99% of ops on ANE; a longer-context or
  unchunked graph has to chunk explicitly.
- **Cache updates need ANE-legal ops.** A KV cache can be a fixed-shape state tensor updated in place
  each step (Core ML's stateful-model example does exactly that), so autoregressive decode is not
  inherently off-limits. What matters is the update op. PocketTTS's flowlm writes its cache with a
  rank-5 `scatter`, which the ANE compiler rejects at any precision. Our Qwen3-0.6B trial showed the
  same pattern: the prefill graph placed 1918/1919 ops on ANE while the decode graph was rejected
  by the ANE compiler. We did not isolate the offending op, so read that as consistent with an
  op-legality problem rather than proof of one.

**Why the GPU wins those graphs today.** A RoPE transformer encoder is a stack of large dense GEMMs
plus softmax, which GPU kernels stream at full memory bandwidth with no layout rewrite. The Parakeet v3
encoder shipping on `.cpuAndGPU` (+8% RTFx) is this effect, not a tuning accident. The mirror image holds
on NVIDIA hardware: tensor cores are GEMM engines, so convolutions must be lowered to implicit GEMM and
small-channel speech convs utilize them poorly. An architecture chosen for GPU training throughput tends
to need reformulation for the ANE, and vice versa.

Practical consequence: for transformer graphs, treat the ANE as a *power/residency* play (fits in
95–200 MB, frees the GPU, sips battery on iOS) that usually costs peak Mac throughput, and expect to
earn residency via graph surgery — channels-first layout, static shapes, chunked intermediates,
split graphs, ANE-legal cache updates, quantization — rather than a config flag. For conv graphs,
the ANE is usually free performance.
