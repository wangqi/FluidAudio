### ASR Model Compilation

Core ML first-load compile times captured on iPhone 16 Pro Max and iPhone 13 running the
parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-coreml bundle. Cold-start compilation happens the first time each Core ML model
is loaded; subsequent loads hit the cached binaries. Warm compile metrics were collected only on the
iPhone 16 Pro Max run, and only for models that were reloaded during the session.

| Model         | iPhone 16 Pro Max cold (ms) | iPhone 16 Pro Max warm (ms) | iPhone 13 cold (ms) | Compute units               |
| ------------- | --------------------------: | ---------------------------: | ------------------: | --------------------------- |

## Parakeet Unified (English, batch + streaming)

Unified FastConformer-RNNT — one checkpoint serves both offline batch and chunked-attention
streaming, English with punctuation and capitalization. Greedy RNNT decode (no TDT duration
head); batch and streaming share the same decoder and differ only in the encoder window
(offline 15 s full-attention vs streaming 7.68 s chunked).

Model: [FluidInference/parakeet-unified-en-0.6b-coreml](https://huggingface.co/FluidInference/parakeet-unified-en-0.6b-coreml)

Hardware: Apple M5 Pro, macOS 26. Encoder int8 on ANE (`.cpuAndNeuralEngine`).

> **iOS note:** the int8 encoder is verified on M-series only. On A16 (iPhone 14 Pro) it fails
> to load on every compute unit — including `.cpuOnly` — even from an intact download
> ([#828](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio/issues/828)). Use `encoderPrecision: .fp16`
> on iOS; it loads and transcribes on the same device.

### LibriSpeech test-clean (2620 files, 5.40h audio)

| Mode      | WER (Avg) | Aggregate WER | Median WER | Overall RTFx | Median RTFx | Long files (>15s) |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Batch     | 2.15%     | 1.68%         | 0.00%      | 123.3x       | 111.5x      | 238               |
| Streaming | 2.21%     | 1.79%         | 0.00%      | 29.1x        | 53.1x       | 238               |

Same harness and `TextNormalizer` as `asr-benchmark`, so directly comparable to the
Transcription numbers above: Parakeet TDT v3 = 2.6% Avg WER / 110x RTFx (multilingual, no
punctuation). For English files, Unified batch wins on WER, throughput, and punctuation; TDT v3
remains the multilingual option.

- **Avg WER** is the mean of per-file WER (matches `asr-benchmark`); **Aggregate WER** is total errors ÷ total words.
- Long files (> 15 s) are not skipped — batch uses overlapping 15 s windows merged on a 2 s overlap; streaming runs them as one continuous session.
- Streaming's overall RTFx falls below its median because it re-encodes a 7.68 s window per 1.04 s chunk (the latency tax) — long files amortize that poorly. Batch only re-encodes the 2 s overlap, so throughput stays flat. **Use batch for files, streaming for live audio.**
- int8 encoder is WER-lossless vs fp16 (within noise) at half the size.

```bash
# Full benchmark, both modes (auto-downloads dataset + models)
swift run -c release fluidaudiocli unified-benchmark --mode both

# Single mode, limited files, or fp16 encoder
swift run -c release fluidaudiocli unified-benchmark --mode streaming --max-files 100
swift run -c release fluidaudiocli unified-benchmark --mode batch --precision fp16
```

## Nemotron Speech Streaming 0.6B (English)

Cache-aware FastConformer-RNNT streaming, English. Mel features are computed **natively in
Swift** (`NemotronMelExtractor` → `AudioMelSpectrogram`, NeMo `normalize: NA` raw log-mel) —
there is no CoreML preprocessor stage. It was removed in the issue #739 fix: the preprocessor's
flexible `RangeDim` audio input was the source of the `ios17.slice_by_index: zero shape error`
("Skipped adding default_function to entry point: main") ANE warning behind the iPadOS
cold-start empty-transcript failure. Encoder int8 on ANE (`.cpuAndNeuralEngine`).

Model: [FluidInference/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b-coreml](https://huggingface.co/FluidInference/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b-coreml)

### LibriSpeech test-clean (2620 files, 53,120 words, ~5.4h audio)

| Chunk tier | Aggregate WER | RTFx | Errors / words |
|------------|---------------|------|----------------|
| 560 ms (lowest latency) | 2.71%     | 40.7x | 1442 / 53120 |
| 1120 ms (trained chunk) | **2.58%** | 24.3x | 1369 / 53120 |
| 2240 ms (default)       | 2.64%     | 87.4x | 1403 / 53120 |

- **WER** is aggregate (total errors ÷ total words across all 2620 files).
- **RTFx** is end-to-end single-stream (Swift mel + int8 ANE encode + greedy RNN-T), release
  build, Apple Silicon; absolute RTFx is machine/load-dependent, relative ordering is stable.
- Accuracy is essentially flat across tiers (2.58–2.71%). 1120 ms has the best WER but lowest
  throughput; 2240 ms (default) is the throughput sweet spot, within ~0.06 pp of the best WER.
- Parity: `NemotronMelExtractor` matches NeMo PyTorch raw log-mel to max |Δ| ≈ 9e-3 — the WER
  here confirms end-to-end correctness (a wrong mel front-end would collapse WER).
- Multilingual FLEURS results: see [NemotronMultilingual.md](ASR/NemotronMultilingual.md).

```bash
swift run -c release fluidaudiocli nemotron-benchmark --subset test-clean --chunk <560|1120|2240>

## Text-to-Speech

We generated the same strings with to generate audio between 1s to ~300s in order to test the speed across a range of varying inputs on Pytorch CPU, MPS, and MLX pipeline, and compared it against the native Swift version with Core ML models.

Each pipeline warmed up the models by running through it once with pesudo inputs, and then comparing the raw inference time with the model already loaded. You can see that for the Core ML model, we traded lower memory and very slightly faster inference for longer initial warm-up.

Note that the Pytorch kokoro model in Pytorch has a memory leak issue: https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro/issues/152

The following tests were ran on M4 Pro, 48GB RAM, Macbook Pro. If you have another device, please do try replicating it as well!

## Voice Activity Detection

Model is nearly identical to the base model in terms of quality, performance wise we see an up to ~3.5x improvement compared to the silero Pytorch VAD model with the 256ms batch model (8 chunks of 32ms)

### FSMN-VAD (`fsmn-vad-segment`)

> **Beta:** FSMN-VAD is a beta model conversion; results and model artifacts may change.

CoreML FSMN-VAD (FunASR, ~5.2M), an alternative to silero-vad. Model: [FluidInference/fsmn-vad-coreml](https://huggingface.co/FluidInference/fsmn-vad-coreml). 2-stage: fbank80+LFR preprocessor (fp32/CPU) → FSMN scorer (fp16/ANE, enumerated buckets) → host decision (port of FunASR `FsmnVADStreaming`). Hardware: Apple M5 Pro.

Evaluated on the **mini50** labeled set via the standard `vad-benchmark` harness (per-clip speech/non-speech), same metric as the silero baseline:

| Backend | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 | RTFx |
|---------|----------|-----------|--------|----|------|
| silero (baseline) | 82.0% | 73.5% | 100% | 84.7% | 1408× |
| **FSMN-VAD** | **98.0%** | **96.2%** | 100% | **98.0%** | 640× |

FSMN-VAD is far more precise (96.2% vs 73.5%) at the same 100% recall — many fewer false speech detections — at ~640× real-time. Fidelity vs FunASR's own segments: frame F1 97.4%, boundaries within ~50 ms (`vad_bench.py` in the conversion repo).

Full [FluidInference/musan](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FluidInference/musan) noise set (774 noise clips) — noise rejection / specificity (correctly classified non-speech):

| Backend | Noise rejected (specificity) | False-positive rate | RTFx |
|---------|------------------------------|---------------------|------|
| silero | 69.8% | 30.2% | 1341× |
| **FSMN-VAD** | **81.9%** | **18.1%** | 571× |

On the full MUSAN noise set FSMN-VAD rejects 12 pp more noise as non-speech (18% vs 30% false positives) — consistently more precise than silero on both the balanced (mini50) and noise-heavy (full MUSAN) evaluations.

Long audio is processed in ~30 s chunks (the FSMN's dilated conv needs fixed shapes; RangeDim is rejected by the ANE/BNNS compiler).

## SenseVoice

Non-autoregressive multilingual ASR using SenseVoiceSmall (FunASR, ~234M) converted to CoreML — SANM encoder + single CTC head, all tokens in one forward pass. See [ASR/SenseVoice.md](ASR/SenseVoice.md) for the architecture and conversion notes.

Model: [FluidInference/sensevoice-small-coreml](https://huggingface.co/FluidInference/sensevoice-small-coreml)

Hardware: Apple M5 Pro, macOS 26. FP16 encoder on the Neural Engine (`CPU_AND_NE`); FP32 CPU front-end. Full canonical test sets, directly comparable to the published [SenseVoice-Small results](https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/SenseVoice).

### LibriSpeech test-clean (2620 files)

| Metric | CoreML (ANE) | Official SenseVoice-Small |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| WER (Avg) | **3.22%** | ~3.1% |
| Median RTFx | 299x | — |

### AISHELL-1 Chinese (7176 files)

| Metric | CoreML (ANE) | Official SenseVoice-Small |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| CER (Avg) | **3.09%** | ~2.9% |
| Median RTFx | 382x | — |

### int8 encoder variant (`--int8`)

Post-training weight quantization of the encoder — **~half the size, accuracy-neutral** vs fp16 (run on ANE). Full canonical test sets:

| | size | LibriSpeech WER | AISHELL CER | peak RAM |
|---|------|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| fp16 (default) | 447 MB | 3.22% | 3.09% | 0.54 GB |
| **int8** | **225 MB** | **3.25%** | **3.09%** | **0.32 GB** |

(Δ +0.03 pp / 0.00 pp on the full LibriSpeech test-clean (2,620) / AISHELL-1 test (7,176), 0 NaN.) int4 per-tensor palettization wrecks accuracy (WER 31%) and is not shipped.

**Methodology notes:**
- CER (character-level, whitespace removed) is the primary metric for Chinese, matching the official SenseVoice chart (AISHELL-1 test).
- Both numbers reproduce the published SenseVoice-Small results, confirming the CoreML conversion (front-end + encoder + decode) is faithful.
- CoreML↔PyTorch parity additionally verified on FLEURS: en WER Δ +0.00pp, zh CER Δ −0.03pp (100 samples/lang).
- The FP16 encoder is correct only on the Neural Engine (NaN on the CPU/GPU FP16 path); non-ANE hardware uses the `--fp32` build. See [ASR/SenseVoice.md](ASR/SenseVoice.md#conversion-notes--findings).
- AISHELL-1 dataset: [TwinkStart/AISHELL-1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TwinkStart/AISHELL-1).

```bash
# FLEURS WER/CER (in-repo, multilingual)
swift run -c release fluidaudiocli sensevoice-benchmark --languages en_us,cmn_hans_cn --samples all
```

## Paraformer

Non-autoregressive Mandarin (zh) ASR: SANM encoder + CIF predictor (host
integrate-and-fire) + parallel decoder. See [ASR/Paraformer.md](ASR/Paraformer.md).

Model: [FluidInference/paraformer-large-zh-coreml](https://huggingface.co/FluidInference/paraformer-large-zh-coreml)

Hardware: Apple M5 Pro, macOS 26. Encoder/CifAlphas/decoder on ANE; FP32 CPU front-end.

### AISHELL-1 Chinese (7176 files, full test, full-CoreML pipeline)

| Precision | size (enc+dec) | CER | median RTFx | peak RAM | Official |
|-----------|----------------|-----|-------------|----------|----------|
| fp16 (default) | 411 MB | **2.12%** | 85× | 0.38 GB | ~1.95% |
| int8 | 207 MB | **2.12%** | 84× | 0.24 GB | ~1.95% |

**Methodology notes:**
- CER (character-level, whitespace removed) is the primary metric for Chinese, matching the official Paraformer-large AISHELL-1 number.
- int8 weight quantization (encoder + decoder) is accuracy-neutral (CER unchanged on the full set), ~half the size/memory.
- The ~0.17 pp gap vs official is fp16 + the fixed-shape decoder (enc 512 / tokens 128). RTFx (~85×) is lower than SenseVoice (~400×) because Paraformer runs 3 CoreML predicts/clip + the decoder pads short clips to 512 frames — an enumerated decoder would raise it.
- AISHELL-1 dataset: [TwinkStart/AISHELL-1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TwinkStart/AISHELL-1).

swift run -c release fluidaudiocli paraformer-transcribe audio.wav         # fp16

## Streaming ASR (Parakeet EOU)

Real-time streaming ASR with End-of-Utterance detection using the Parakeet EOU 120M CoreML model.

Model: [FluidInference/parakeet-realtime-eou-120m-coreml](https://huggingface.co/FluidInference/parakeet-realtime-eou-120m-coreml)

Hardware: Apple M2, 2022, macOS 26

### LibriSpeech test-clean (2620 files, 5.40h audio)

| Chunk Size | WER (Avg) | Median WER | RTFx | Total Time |
|------------|-----------|------------|------|------------|
| 320ms      | 4.88%     | 0.00%      | 19.25x | 1015s (16.9m) |
| 160ms      | 8.23%     | 5.26%      | 5.78x  | 3387s (56.4m) |


```bash
# Run 320ms benchmark

# Run 160ms benchmark
swift run -c release fluidaudiocli parakeet-eou --benchmark --chunk-size 160 --use-cache
```

## Streaming ASR (Nemotron, English)

NVIDIA's Nemotron Speech Streaming 0.6B for streaming ASR. The default tier is now
**2240ms with B1-fused decode** (decoder+joint merged into one CoreML call per step) —
it trades ~1.1 s of chunk latency for throughput at no accuracy cost. Pass an explicit
`NemotronChunkSize` / `--chunk` (1120/560/160/80) for lower-latency tiers.

Model: [FluidInference/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b-coreml](https://huggingface.co/FluidInference/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b-coreml)

Hardware: Apple M5 Pro, macOS 26.5. Encoder int8 on ANE (`.cpuAndNeuralEngine`).

### LibriSpeech test-clean (100 files)

Three tiers, all from one conversion with B1-fused decode (`decoder_joint.mlmodelc`):

| Tier | WER | RTFx | Δ vs 1120ms |
|------|-----|------|-------------|
| 560ms | 2.28% | 42.1 | −35% |
| 1120ms | 2.28% | 65.0 | — |
| **2240ms (default)** | **2.46%** | **93.6** | **+44%** |

WER is neutral across tiers (within n=100 noise). 2240ms = 2× the trained 14-encoder-frame
chunk (the chunked-attention mask still tiles cleanly); B1 fusion = one CoreML call per
decode step instead of two (~+15% on any tier shipping `decoder_joint.mlmodelc`). The v1
160ms/80ms tiers were removed (off-tiling, degraded WER).

**Encoder optimization notes (M5 Pro):**
- **6-bit palettization beats int8** on every axis — 2.24% WER, +9% RTFx, smaller (422 MB vs
  564 MB). Planned follow-up to replace the shipped int8 encoder.
- **Encoder placement / iOS:** ANE gives the fastest inference but slowest load (the iOS
  ~1.4 GB / ~130 s residency wall for the 24-layer encoder). On iOS, running the encoder on
  **CPU** (instant load, ~140 MB, ~66 RTFx) is ~2× faster than 4-way ANE sharding (~33 RTFx)
  — so CPU, not sharding, is the iOS encoder choice. macOS / plugged-in stays on ANE.

> All three tiers are a faithful conversion of the public `nvidia/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b`
> checkpoint (decoder & joint match PyTorch at cos=1.0) and replace the previous v1 tiers. WER
> parity against NVIDIA's internal tuning of the same model is a tracked follow-up; the ladder
> above is internally consistent (one conversion for all tiers) and reports the relative gains.

```bash
# Default (2240ms + B1)
swift run -c release fluidaudiocli nemotron-benchmark --max-files 100

# Lower-latency tier
swift run -c release fluidaudiocli nemotron-benchmark --chunk 1120 --max-files 100
```

## Streaming ASR (Nemotron Multilingual)

NVIDIA's Nemotron 3.5 ASR Streaming Multilingual 0.6B — real-time streaming RNN-T
covering ~40 language-locales, fully on-device. Two models share one encoder per
tier: `latin` (en/es/fr/it/pt/de, 2,828-token script-pruned vocab) and
`multilingual` (zh/ja + 100+ via `prompt_id`, full 13,087 vocab).

Model: [FluidInference/Nemotron-3.5-ASR-Streaming-Multilingual-0.6b-CoreML](https://huggingface.co/FluidInference/Nemotron-3.5-ASR-Streaming-Multilingual-0.6b-CoreML)

Hardware: Apple M5 Pro, macOS 26.5. Encoder/decoder/joint on ANE
(`.cpuAndNeuralEngine`), CoreML iOS 17 target. Per-file sum-aggregate RTFx, 2.24 s
(2240 ms) tier, B1 fused decode.

### LibriSpeech test-clean (English, 2620 files, 5.40h audio)

| Model | Vocab | WER | RTFx |
|-------|-------|-----|------|
| `latin` | 2,828 | 3.6% | 124x |
| `multilingual` | 13,087 | 3.2% | 76x |

`latin` is ~1.6× faster than the full-vocab model on the same English audio
(smaller per-frame joint matmul) at ~0.4 pp WER. English WER uses the HF
`EnglishTextNormalizer` (Open ASR Leaderboard convention).

### FLEURS (full test splits, 2.24 s tier)

| Language | Model | WER / CER | RTFx |
|----------|-------|-----------|------|
| English (en) | `latin` | 8.96% | 130x |
| Spanish (es) | `latin` | 4.80% | 140x |
| French (fr) | `latin` | 9.52% | 130x |
| Italian (it) | `latin` | 5.41% | 147x |
| Portuguese (pt) | `latin` | 6.14% | 141x |
| German (de) | `latin` | 9.83% | 144x |
| Chinese (zh) | `multilingual` | 18.57% CER | 89x |
| Japanese (ja) | `multilingual` | 13.79% CER | 84x |

FLEURS is multi-domain and digit-bearing, so it runs higher than test-clean for
the same model. Reference and hypothesis are normalized with
[`text-processing-rs`](https://github.com/FluidInference/text-processing-rs) —
FluidInference's Rust port of NVIDIA NeMo's (inverse) text-normalization grammars
(~98.6% NeMo-suite compatibility) — to match NVIDIA's FLEURS scoring; zh/ja are
scored as CER. (The `nemotron-multilingual-benchmark` CLI's built-in scorer uses
a lighter Swift normalizer, so non-English numbers it prints may differ slightly
from these.) The full-vocab `multilingual` model is chunk-sensitive — use the 2 s
tier for zh/ja.

```bash
# LibriSpeech test-clean (English)
swift run -c release fluidaudiocli nemotron-multilingual-benchmark \
  --dataset librispeech --librispeech-subset test-clean --model-dir <model-dir>

# FLEURS per-language
swift run -c release fluidaudiocli nemotron-multilingual-benchmark \
  --dataset fleurs --languages en_us,es_419,fr_fr,it_it,pt_br,de_de,cmn_hans_cn,ja_jp \
  --model-dir <model-dir>
```

## Speaker Diarization

Both offline and online versions use the community-1 model (via FluidInference/speaker-diarization-coreml).

### CAM++ speaker embedding (`campplus-embed`)

> **Beta:** CAM++ is a beta model conversion; results and model artifacts may change.

CoreML CAM++ (FunASR, ~7.2M) speaker-embedding extractor. Model: [FluidInference/campplus-coreml](https://huggingface.co/FluidInference/campplus-coreml). 2-stage: fbank80 preprocessor (fp32/CPU) → CAM++ (RangeDim, CPU/GPU) → 192-d L2-normalized embedding. Hardware: Apple M5 Pro.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **AISHELL-1 EER** | **0.48%** |
| Same-speaker cosine (mean) | 0.805 |
| Different-speaker cosine (mean) | 0.256 |
| Trial set | 20 speakers, 6000 same / 6000 different pairs |

**Notes:**
- EER on AISHELL-1 (clean, read Mandarin) — easier than the official CN-Celeb benchmark (~6–7%); this validates the CoreML embedding discriminates speakers (CoreML↔torch embedding cosine 0.9997–0.99999).
- Speaker id parsed from the AISHELL `name` field (`BAC009S0764W...` → `S0764`).

```bash
swift run -c release fluidaudiocli campplus-embed a.wav b.wav   # cosine similarity
```

### Offline diarization pipeline

For slightly ~1.2% worse DER we default to a higher step ratio segmentation duration than the baseline community-1 pipeline. This allows us to get nearly ~2x the speed (as expected because we're processing 1/2 of the embeddings). For highly critical use cases, one may should use step ratio = 0.1 and minSegmentDurationSeconds = 0.0

Running on the full voxconverse benchmark:

```bash
StepRatio = 0.2, minSegmentDurationSeconds= 1.0
Average DER: 15.07% | Median DER: 10.70% | Average JER: 39.40% | Median JER: 40.95% (collar=0.25s, ignoreOverlap=True)
Average RTFx: 122.06 (from 232 clips)
Completed. New results: 232, Skipped existing: 0, Total attempted: 232
Step Ratio 2, min duration 1.0


StepRatio = 0.1, minSegmentDurationSeconds= 0
Average DER: 13.89% | Median DER: 10.49% | Average JER: 42.84% | Median JER: 43.30% (collar=0.25s, ignoreOverlap=True)
Average RTFx: 64.75 (from 232 clips)
Completed. New results: 232, Skipped existing: 0, Total attempted: 232
Step Ratio 1, min duration 0 (edited) 
```

Note that the baseline pytorch version is ~11% DER, we lost some precision dropping down to fp16 precision in order to run most of the embedding model on neural engine. But as a result, we significantly out perform the baseline `mps` backend as well. the pyannote-community-1 on cpu is ~1.5-2 RTFx, on mps, it's ~20-25 RTFx.

Running on the full AMI SDM 16-meeting test set (official NeMo/pyannote evaluation split: EN2002, ES2004, IS1009, TS3003 × a-d). Re-run 2026-07-03 on an Apple M5 Pro:

```bash
swift run -c release fluidaudiocli diarization-benchmark --mode offline \

12/16 meetings detect the correct speaker count. Average DER 10.62% matches published pyannote-community-1 offline numbers on this split (~11-12%). Results are fully deterministic (two consecutive runs produce bit-identical metrics).

**Clustering threshold matters on this split.** The table above predates #801 and uses `--threshold 0.7` under the old (inverted) threshold semantics. Since #801 the threshold is a Euclidean cut distance applied directly to the AHC dendrogram (pyannote parity): **larger values merge more aggressively and yield fewer speakers**. Old values map to new ones via `sqrt(2 − 2·old)` — the old default 0.6 behaved like a cut at 0.894, and the old `--threshold 0.7` from this table behaves like `--threshold 0.775` today. The CLI default remains the community-1 preset value (0.6), now interpreted as pyannote does.

### Streaming/online Diarization

This is more tricky and honestly a lot more fragile to clustering. Expect substantially worse DER than the offline pipeline — the tail meetings suffer heavy speaker confusion. Only use this when you critically need realtime streaming speaker diarization. In most cases, offline is more than enough for most applications.

All streaming tables below were re-run 2026-07-03 on an Apple M5 Pro against the official AMI SDM 16-meeting test set (same split as the offline table above; earlier revisions of these tables used a different 7-meeting subset, so numbers are not directly comparable to those).

Takeaways from the 2026-07-03 sweep: on the official 16-meeting split, no-overlap configs clearly beat overlap configs (10s/0s 38.2% and 5s/0s 39.0% vs 3s/1s 53.3% and 5s/2s 55.9% average DER) — overlap increases chunk count and drives over-clustering (5-11 detected speakers vs 4 truth on the worst meetings). Note: the two overlap configs were measured one meeting per process; running many overlapping-chunk meetings back-to-back in a single process can exhaust IOSurface-backed CoreML buffers on macOS (E5RT `Failed to allocate memory IOSurface object`).

### Offline throughput (M5 Pro)

A single fused offline graph (`mel[1,128,3072] → speaker_preds`, 30.72 s window) exported via the
NeMo offline path — one CoreML call per window, no streaming state. ComputeUnit.ALL, median of 120
runs after 12 warmup:

| variant | model-exec (mel → preds) | RTFx |
|---|---:|---:|
| **fp16** | **10.65 ms** | **2884×** |
| 6-bit palettized | 10.93 ms | 2809× |

End-to-end incl. mel (fp16): 12.49 ms · 2459×. One fused GPU graph — no per-call dispatch or
ANE→GPU handoff. Numerical parity vs the PyTorch reference: 100% speaker-argmax agreement (fp16).

### Offline diarizer (whole-file, Swift)

`OfflineSortformerDiarizer` runs the fused offline model end-to-end: mel extraction → fused graph
per 30.72 s window (no streaming state) → timeline. Run with `fluidaudio sortformer <file> --offline`
(`--palettized` for the 6-bit set). Models: `FluidInference/diar-streaming-sortformer-coreml`
`v3/{fp16,palettized}/SortformerOffline_v2.1.mlmodelc`; NeMo-reference parity = 100% speaker-argmax
(fp16), 96.4% (6-bit palettized).

**Throughput** is excellent — ~1000–1400× RTFx (one fused call per window, no per-chunk state). Voice
detection matches streaming exactly (identical Miss/FA on AMI).

**Quality caveat — not for long multi-speaker audio.** Each 30.72 s window diarizes independently
with no speaker cache, so on long meetings with several speakers it produces large speaker confusion.
AMI-SDM (collar 0.25, full test set), same harness:

| | DER | Miss | FA | Speaker confusion | RTFx |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Streaming (`highContextV2_1`) | **26.4%** | 23.4 | 0.6 | **2.4** | 835× |
| Offline (whole-file) | 56.7% | 23.4 | 0.6 | **32.7** | 1418× |

Detection is identical; the entire gap is speaker confusion the streaming `spkcache` avoids by
construction (accumulating speaker profiles across the whole history). Cross-window re-stitching does
not recover it — the confusion is generated *within* each window — so **use offline for short clips
(≤ ~30 s), few-speaker audio, or throughput-bound batch jobs, and use the streaming variants for
accurate long-form multi-speaker diarization.**

## LS-EEND Streaming Diarization
A research prototype from Westlake University for streaming speaker diarization.

Model: [FluidInference/lseend-coreml](https://huggingface.co/FluidInference/lseend-coreml).

Hardware: Apple M4 MAX, 2026, macOS 26.1 (CPU only)

### AMI SDM Dataset (AMI variant, `--step-size 500ms`)

Each LS-EEND CoreML bundle is keyed by `(variant, stepSize)`. The run below uses the `.ami` variant with `.step500ms`, which commits 5 output frames (~500 ms) per CoreML call.

```bash
swift run fluidaudiocli lseend-benchmark --variant ami --step-size 500ms --auto-download
```

## Multilingual G2P (Grapheme-to-Phoneme)

CharsiuG2P ByT5 encoder-decoder model converted to CoreML for multilingual grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. Used by Kokoro TTS for non-English phonemization.

Model: [FluidInference/charsiu-g2p-byt5-coreml](https://huggingface.co/FluidInference/charsiu-g2p-byt5-coreml)

Hardware: Apple M2, 2022, macOS 26

### CharsiuG2P Test Set (500 words/language)

```bash
swift run -c release fluidaudiocli g2p-benchmark --data-dir /path/to/CharsiuG2P/data/test
```

| Language | PER | WER | ms/word |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spanish | 0.1% | 0.8% | 32.6 |
| French | 0.8% | 2.0% | 26.5 |
| Italian | 2.8% | 20.0% | 20.9 |
| Hindi | 4.5% | 21.4% | 45.4 |
| Japanese | 10.5% | 23.8% | 31.7 |
| Portuguese (BR) | 8.9% | 43.2% | 24.0 |
| British English | 13.6% | 29.4% | 34.0 |
| American English | 19.0% | 38.8% | 28.2 |
| Chinese | 86.2%* | 95.0%* | 53.9 |
| **Average** | **16.3%** | **30.5%** | **33.0** |

*\*Chinese PER is inflated due to tone notation mismatch between model output and reference data (tone contour marks vs model format), not a model accuracy issue.*

- **PER** (Phoneme Error Rate): Character-level Levenshtein distance / reference length, stress marks stripped
- **WER** (Word Error Rate): Fraction of words with any phoneme error

### Compute Unit Comparison

Both the English BART G2P and multilingual ByT5 G2P models run fastest on CPU-only due to GPU/ANE dispatch overhead on small autoregressive decoder steps.

**Multilingual G2P (ByT5)**

| Compute Units | ms/word |
|---|---|
| cpuOnly | **38.7** |
| cpuAndGPU | 94.7 |
| all (ANE+GPU+CPU) | 95.2 |

**English G2P (BART)**

| Compute Units | ms/word |
|---|---|
| cpuOnly | **13.0** |
| all (ANE+GPU+CPU) | 17.3 |
| cpuAndGPU | 23.4 |
