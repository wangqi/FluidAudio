# Long Transcription

This document explains the Parakeet TDT long-form batch path and the quality
issues that are easy to miss when testing only short clips.

## Overview

Parakeet TDT Core ML models accept a fixed encoder window of 240,000 samples
(15 seconds at 16 kHz). Longer files are split into overlapping chunks, decoded,
and merged back into one transcript.

Most long-transcription regressions happen at chunk seams. A short benchmark can
look healthy while a longer recording still loses words, repeats fragments, or
drifts into the wrong language after several boundaries. FLEURS is useful as a
multilingual smoke test, but most FLEURS samples are short read-speech clips, so
they do not exercise repeated seam behavior very much.

## Chunk Geometry

The numbers below come from `ASRConstants` and `ChunkProcessor`. They are not
configurable at runtime — they are derived from the encoder's frame rate and
the Core ML window size — so they are the same on every device.

| Quantity | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Sample rate | 16,000 Hz | `ASRConstants.sampleRate` |
| Encoder window | 240,000 samples (≈ 15.00 s) | `ASRConstants.maxModelSamples` |
| Encoder frame | 1,280 samples (80 ms) | `ASRConstants.samplesPerEncoderFrame` |
| Mel hop | 160 samples (10 ms) | `ASRConstants.melHopSize` |
| Visible chunk | ≈ 14.96 s, frame-aligned | `ChunkProcessor.chunkSamples(...)` |
| Overlap target | 2.0 s, frame-aligned, capped at `chunkSamples / 2` | `ChunkProcessor.overlapSeconds` |
| Stride | `chunkSamples − overlap`, frame-aligned | `ChunkProcessor.strideSamples(...)` |
| Minimum seam overlap | 6 encoder frames (480 ms) | `silenceAlignedChunkStarts` |

`chunkSamples` is the *visible* window decoded into transcript tokens; it is
slightly smaller than `maxModelSamples` to reserve room for either an 80 ms
mel-context prepend (default path) or a 0–7 frame acoustic warmup prefix
(no-mel paths). Visible windows are always whole numbers of encoder frames, so
chunk timestamps land on frame boundaries.

## Failure Modes

When reviewing long-form ASR output, check the transcript for:

- boundary word drops, especially short function words or one-word clauses
- duplicated words or partial BPE fragments around overlaps
- glued words (two words joined without a space) or hybrid words stitched
  from both windows' segmentation of the same seam word — `"worksks"`,
  `"automoti"`, mid-word punctuation like `"ye,ah"` (issue #683)
- subword or word order scrambled *across* a seam — subwords of two
  adjacent words interleaved (`"im Frühjahr"` → `"imüh Frjahr"`), two words
  swapped (`"Für die"` → `"die Für"`), or a word's own pieces rearranged
  (`"Punkt"` → `"Pktun"`). Fixed in PR #830 — see "Token Order Is
  Authoritative" (issue #825)
- missing clauses or full sentences after a boundary
- wrong-language insertions in otherwise single-language audio
- wrong-script bursts on multilingual v3 audio
- sentence breaks or punctuation that move far enough to change readability
- real mixed-language switches being removed or delayed
- multi-second spans of clear speech missing at a seam whose overlap region
  is low-SNR — crosstalk, applause, soft speech (issue #758)
- trailing words missing entirely when the *final* window decodes to
  all-blank on quiet recordings — ends early with high confidence and no
  error (issue #747)

Aggregate WER can hide these problems. A transcript with a good average score
may still be unusable if a seam drops a sentence or inserts a wrong-language
phrase at the wrong point.

## Current Paths

| Path | Enabled by | Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mel-context | `ASRConfig.melChunkContext = true`, CLI `--mel-context` (default for non-v3 models) | Batch TDT long audio | Preserves the existing 80 ms left-context behavior for non-first chunks. |
| v3 no-mel | Default for v3 (`melChunkContext = nil`); explicit via `ASRConfig.melChunkContext = false`, CLI `--no-mel-context` | Parakeet TDT v3 batch long audio | Avoids the v3 multilingual drift introduced by prepending mel context at chunk boundaries (#594), and — via silence-aligned chunk starts — the quiet-speech drops near long mid-file silence runs (#803). |
| v3 dual-decode arbitration | `ASRConfig.dualDecodeArbitration = true` on the v3 no-mel path, CLI `--dual-decode-arbitration` | Parakeet TDT v3 no-mel batch long audio | Opt-in quality mode for files where one boundary strategy is clearly safer than another. |
| Parallel chunk workers | `ASRConfig.parallelChunkConcurrency` (default `4`, clamped to `>= 1`) | Stateless chunked batch TDT (all of the above) | Decodes independent chunks concurrently across a worker pool of cloned `AsrManager` instances. |
| Post-merge repair pass | `ASRConfig.seamGapRepair = true` (default), CLI `--no-seam-gap-repair` | Multi-chunk batch TDT (all of the above) | Re-decodes suspicious inter-token gaps with fresh seam-free windows, splicing recovered tokens in. See "Post-Merge Repair Pass". |

The dual-decode path probes the first few non-first chunks with three strategies:

- silence-aligned boundaries without warmup
- silence-aligned boundaries with a hidden short real-audio warmup prefix
- regular fixed-stride boundaries without warmup

After the probe, the whole file commits to one strategy; probe ties go to the
warmup-free path (the content-safer default). Per-file commitment keeps the
overlap merger from stitching together adjacent chunks decoded under different
boundary rules, which was one source of mid-word artifacts and clause loss.

The choice is based on decoder confidence, emitted-token counts, and agreement
between probe paths. It is meant to decide between chunking strategies, not to
rewrite transcript text. The mechanism is language-agnostic (no text
inspection, no vocabulary/script/token filtering, no language hints).
Off by default: the wins are quality-tier rather than correctness-tier, and
the probe adds a modest constant overhead (≈1.1–1.5× depending on file
length) over the regular `melChunkContext = false` path.

## Boundary Search

`ChunkProcessor` picks the start sample of each non-first chunk by one of two
strategies, selected from `melChunkContext` and `modelVersion`:

| Mode | When | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `regularChunkStarts` | Default mel-context path, or non-v3 models | Fixed stride: `start_i = i × strideSamples`. Cheap, predictable, but ignores acoustic content at the seam. |
| `silenceAlignedChunkStarts` | `melChunkContext = false` *and* model version is v3 | Searches for a low-energy frame near the target boundary and starts the chunk there. |

The silence-aligned search is two-tier:

1. **Silence pass.** Within `±4 s` of the target frame, score each candidate
   frame by mean-square energy in a `±80 ms` window (`boundaryEnergyScore`).
   A candidate is accepted as "near silence" if its score is at most
   `0.05 × medianScore` over the window. Adaptive thresholds let the search
   tolerate noisy recordings without re-tuning a hardcoded absolute energy.
2. **Valley fallback.** If no near-silence candidate is found, repeat the same
   search within `±0.5 s` and accept the best candidate if it scores below
   `0.35 × medianScore`. This catches inter-word valleys when the audio has
   no real silence near the target.
3. **Speech-tail check.** If using a silence boundary would force the *next*
   forced boundary (`candidate + chunkSamples − minOverlap`) into speech,
   fall back to the original target start. This prevents pulling a boundary
   too early when doing so would dump a speech-only tail onto the following
   chunk.

The search keeps at least 6 encoder frames (480 ms) of overlap with the
previous chunk so the overlap merger always has at least a handful of
candidate tokens to align on.

## Warmup Prefix vs Mel Context

Non-first chunks always include some samples from before the visible window,
but the two mechanisms behave differently:

- **Mel context** (`melContextSamples`, 1 encoder frame / 80 ms). Prepended to
  the chunk so the FastConformer encoder's depthwise convolutions have stable
  left context for the first emitted frame. The decoder is told to *skip*
  those leading frames via `contextSamples`; they do not produce tokens.
  Enabled when `ASRConfig.melChunkContext` resolves to `true` (the default
  for non-v3 models; v3 defaults to the no-mel path).
- **Warmup prefix** (`warmupPrefixSamples`, 0–7 encoder frames). Real audio
  from before the chunk start, decoded normally from frame 0; emitted tokens
  are suppressed up to the chunk start via `emitTokensAfterFrame`. Used only
  by the v3 no-mel arbitration probe (path B); the default v3 no-mel path
  keeps `warmupPrefixFrames = 0`.

`shouldUseWarmupPrefix` further gates the warmup decision when a silence
boundary is available: if there is at least 200 ms of stable quiet audio in
the 500 ms lookahead from the boundary (`rms < 0.003`), warmup is skipped —
the encoder will see real silence anyway, so there is no language-prior
drift to warm out of.

## Why This Helps

The original long-form path (PR #264) used an 80 ms mel-context prepend so
non-first chunks had stable leading encoder frames. That helps avoid
blank-boundary failures on long English audio (where the encoder otherwise
emits nothing for the first few frames of a chunk).

Issue #594 surfaced a second, opposite failure on `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-coreml`
multilingual audio: the 80 ms prepend can shift the encoder's first-frame
distribution enough that the SOS-primed TDT decoder drifts back to v3's
English prior. The visible symptom is usually not random noise; it is a
plausible-looking phrase in the *wrong* language near a seam (commonly
French → English, also observed Spanish → English).

The earlier attempt to fix that — persisting decoder state across chunks and
extending the audio prefix to 2.0 s of real audio (commit `eb9c19f7`) — was
correct in isolation but incompatible with parallel chunk decoding
(`fcd80f10`, PR #507): every chunk needs to start from a fresh
`TdtDecoderState` for the worker pool to be independent. The shipped fix
keeps decoding stateless per chunk and instead removes the shifting prepend
on v3, with the no-mel path preferring silence-aligned boundaries so the
encoder sees a natural acoustic onset rather than a discontinuity. The
arbitration mode adds a short probe for cases where different boundary
strategies preserve different content; committing globally to one strategy
favors consistency over per-chunk switching.

A third interacting issue from #594 — the decoder occasionally entering a
BLANK-trap after a sentence-final token — was masked by the per-chunk SOS
reset and re-surfaced briefly under persistent state. With stateless
per-chunk decoding restored, this trap is again not reachable through
chunked transcription; long-form streaming paths still guard against it
explicitly.

## Parallel Chunk Processing

Long files are split into independent chunks that share no decoder state across
seams, so chunk decoding parallelizes cleanly. `ChunkProcessor` runs a worker
pool of cloned `AsrManager` instances and merges results in chunk-emission
order, preserving the same overlap merge logic used by the single-worker path.

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ASRConfig.parallelChunkConcurrency` | `4` | Number of chunks decoded concurrently. Clamped to `max(1, …)`. Applies only to stateless chunked transcription paths (long-form batch TDT). |

How it works:

- `ChunkProcessor.process(using:)` reads `manager.parallelChunkConcurrency` and
  builds a worker pool via `manager.makeWorkerClone()`. Each clone reuses the
  already-loaded encoder/decoder/joint Core ML models, so no model
  re-initialization happens per worker.
- Chunks are dispatched with `ThrowingTaskGroup`. The dispatch loop reuses an
  `availableWorkers` index list so the number of in-flight tasks never exceeds
  `parallelChunkConcurrency` (backpressure).
- Each task constructs a fresh `TdtDecoderState` (stateless per-chunk
  decoding), runs `transcribeChunk` against its assigned worker, and returns a
  `TaskResult { index, tokens, workerIndex }`. Results are gathered into a
  pre-sized `chunkOutputs` array indexed by chunk order, then merged exactly
  as the serial path did.
- Streaming and real-time paths
  (`StreamingAsrManager`, `SlidingWindowAsrManager`) are unaffected: they
  remain single-decoder and cache-aware, since they depend on persistent
  decoder/encoder state across windows.

Notes for tuning:

- Default `4` was selected from device-matrix testing; benchmarks on Apple M3
  with a 1-hour file show roughly 2.2–2.8× wall-clock speedup over the serial
  path across Parakeet v2/v3 variants, with about 19–31 MiB extra resident
  memory for the additional worker clones.
- Setting `parallelChunkConcurrency = 1` is the closest configuration to the
  pre-parallel behavior and is useful for A/B-ing transcripts against older
  output. It does not bypass `ChunkProcessor`; the worker pool collapses to a
  single worker that reuses the calling `AsrManager`.
- Word timings and per-chunk decoding are unchanged by the parallel path —
  the parallelization is in chunk dispatch, not in decoder behavior, and
  transcripts and timings remain identical to the serial version for the same
  inputs.

## Overlap Merge

After each chunk decodes independently, `ChunkProcessor.mergeChunks` stitches
adjacent chunks into a single token timeline. The merger never re-runs the
decoder and never invents tokens; it only chooses which side of the overlap
each token comes from. The strategy is a four-step ladder:

1. **Disjoint shortcut.** If the left chunk's last token ends before the
   right chunk's first token begins, concatenate without merging.
2. **Contiguous time-tolerant match.** Tokens in the overlap region are
   compared with a tolerance of `overlapSeconds / 2`. `SequenceMatcher`
   finds the longest contiguous run where the same token ID appears in both
   chunks within the tolerance window; if that run is at least half of the
   overlap, the merger splices both halves around it.
3. **LCS fallback.** If no good contiguous run exists, fall back to a
   longest-common-subsequence match over the same overlap window with the
   same tolerance, then splice using each LCS pair.
4. **Midpoint fallback.** If LCS also returns nothing, split at the midpoint
   of the overlap (`mergeByMidpoint`): keep left-chunk tokens before the
   midpoint and right-chunk tokens after it.

The matcher uses *token ID + frame-time tolerance* rather than text — so it
cannot collapse two different words that happen to share a substring, and it
is robust to small per-chunk timestamp jitter. The contiguous-match path
preserves order strictly; LCS is only entered when adjacent chunks disagree
enough that a contiguous run would be dishonest.

### Token Order Is Authoritative

Each merge step produces tokens in linear text order (left prefix, spliced
seam, right suffix), and `convertTokensToText` builds the transcript by
joining tokens in that array order. The merged order — not the frame
timestamps — is the source of truth for the text.

Frame timestamps are therefore **clamped monotonic, never sorted**
(`enforceMonotonicTimestamps`). A timestamp sort is unsafe as a final pass
because the key is both coarse and non-monotonic across a seam:

- TDT emits several tokens per 80 ms encoder frame, so many tokens share a
  timestamp; sorting on ties can reorder same-frame subwords.
- The two overlapping windows number frames from different global offsets
  (plus mel-context / warmup adjustments), so a token that linearly *follows*
  another can carry a numerically *smaller* timestamp. Sorting then pulls it
  ahead, interleaving subwords from the two windows.

Re-sorting the merged stream by timestamp produced the seam scrambles in
issue #825 (`"im Frühjahr"` → `"imüh Frjahr"`, `"Für die"` → `"die Für"`,
`"Punkt"` → `"Pktun"`) — it discarded the order the splice logic below had
carefully constructed. The clamp instead only raises any backward-stepping
timestamp to the running maximum, leaving token order untouched while keeping
the sequence non-decreasing for word timing, `collapseSeamWordDuplicates`,
and the post-merge repair pass (PR #830).

### Case-Folded Matching and Seam Word Duplicates

A window that begins mid-sentence biases the decoder to capitalize its first
word as a false sentence start. Exact-token-ID matching cannot align
`Meeting` with the previous window's `meeting`, which left duplicated,
mis-cased words at seams — `…the meeting Meeting was…` (issue #706). Two
merge-level fixes (PR #708, shared with the Unified path):

- **Case-folded overlap matching** — `caseVariantCanonicalIds` maps case-only
  token twins to one canonical ID so `tokenIdsMatch` aligns them at the
  seam; the word collapses to the left window's contextually correct casing.
  The all-lower-case variant is chosen as the canonical ID so the collapse
  can tell which copy of a seam duplicate to keep (the lower-cased one has
  real left context); only IDs with a genuine case twin enter the map, so
  exact-ID matching is unchanged for every other token.
- **`collapseSeamWordDuplicates`** — reconstructs SentencePiece *words* from
  the token stream and drops an adjacent case-only duplicate inside the
  overlap window. Word-level reconstruction matters for small subword
  vocabularies where a whole word spans several tokens. Genuine repeats
  ("that that"), same-case duplicates, and real sentence boundaries
  ("…thank you. You said…") are left untouched.

Silence-aligned chunk starts were prototyped for this artifact class and
dropped: on the 15 s offline encoder they measured as a ~1 WER point
regression (Earnings-22 long-form) with no artifact benefit — the fix
belongs in the merge, not the chunk grid.

### Word-Boundary Splice Repair

Matching alone does not make the *splice points* safe: the two windows
tokenize the same seam audio independently, and the right window often
segments its first word differently (frequently without the SentencePiece
`▁` word-start prefix, since for that decoder the word is utterance-initial).
Splicing a continuation piece from the right stream directly after a left
token decodes as a glued or hybrid word — `"work" + "ks"` → `"worksks"`
(issue #683).

To prevent this, `mergeChunks` derives a set of *splice-safe* token IDs from
the model vocabulary once per merge pass: pieces with a `▁`/space prefix or
punctuation-only pieces. Splices are then repaired at word granularity:

- **`mergeUsingMatches`** — when the post-match tail of the right stream
  starts with a continuation piece, the merger adopts the right window's
  segmentation of the entire seam word (the left chunk is typically the one
  cut mid-word). Only when the right stream itself begins mid-word — the
  construction that produced glued words — does the left window keep the
  seam word, with the right stream resuming at its next word-initial piece.
- **`mergeByMidpoint`** — the time cutoff is adjusted so the left stream
  finishes the word it started, and orphaned continuation pieces (whose
  word-initial piece was trimmed away) are dropped from the right stream's
  head.

The repair inspects only the tokenizer's own word-boundary marker, never
transcript text, so it is language-agnostic. Without a vocabulary the merge
is byte-for-byte unchanged.

A follow-up (PR #759) closed three residual *drop* paths in these repairs,
where a seam with no splice-safe token available could silently discard
content instead of gluing it:

- the `mergeUsingMatches` tail fallback now appends the remaining
  continuation pieces when no word-initial resume point exists — a possible
  glue is strictly better than a lost word;
- `popSeamWord` no longer caps the seam-word scan at 12 pieces (the cap
  false-negatived on long agglutinative/Cyrillic BPE words, forcing the
  drop path above);
- the `mergeByMidpoint` right-scan no longer discards the entire right
  window when no safe token exists past the cutoff.

The rule those three share: **a seam may produce a glued word in the worst
case, but it must never delete real content.**

## End-Aligned Final Window (issue #747)

On quiet long-form audio the **final** window used to decode to all-blank
even though its audio held clear speech: a short trailing chunk was
zero-padded up to the model window, so the encoder saw a frame distribution
dominated by digital silence — on speech that is already near the noise
floor (the #747 reproducer peaks below 2 % FS), that was enough to push
every emission to blank. The transcript ended several words early with high
confidence and no error.

The fix is structural, not a repair: the final chunk **fills its window
backwards with real audio instead of zeros**
(`ChunkProcessor.lastChunkWarmupSamples`). The backfilled prefix rides the
existing warmup mechanics — decoded from frame 0, tokens before the
original chunk-start frame suppressed — so the emitted coverage, and
therefore the merge overlap with the previous chunk, is byte-identical to
the old layout. The model simply never sees a degenerate window. The
prepend also gives the final chunk real left acoustic context, replacing
the 80 ms mel-context prepend on that window.

The window ends at the **last speech-bearing frame**
(`speechEndSamples()`: EOF minus the trailing run of frames with RMS below
`speechRmsFloor`), not at EOF. Recordings often end in operator silence or
digital zeros, and the degenerate-decode pathology is not specific to
*padding*: a window that ends in an extended dead-silence run decodes
degenerately even when the silence is recorded. Measured on an Earnings-22
call whose recording ends with ~3 s of digital zeros: the 12 s-speech
window decoded perfectly alone, lost its first half with 1 s of the silent
tail appended, and decoded to **empty** with all 3 s — while the same
window trimmed to the last speech frame recovers everything, including the
"you may now disconnect" closer that the EOF-aligned window dropped.
Nothing transcribable is excluded: the trim threshold is the same
below-any-real-speech floor the repair gate uses. A final chunk whose
remaining audio is entirely sub-floor is skipped outright.

Files shorter than one window are unaffected: they are the whole-file
single-chunk decode, where padding is unavoidable (and harmless — the
window is the file).

The backfill requires prefix suppression (`emitTokensAfterGlobalFrame`),
which only the V3 decoder implements — v3 and tdtJa models get the
end-aligned window; v2/tdtCtc110m keep the zero-padded layout
(`supportsSuppressedPrefix`).

## Streaming Windows (issues #855, #897)

`SlidingWindowAsrManager` decodes overlapping windows (`[left 2 s | chunk |
right 2 s]`, so consecutive windows share 4 s of audio). Every window after
the first is decoded **from frame 0 on a fresh decoder state**
(`TdtDecoderState.make`, exactly as the batch chunker does for every chunk)
with an emission cutoff (`AsrManager.redecodePlan`): tokens for audio the
previous windows already emitted are suppressed at the source, minus a
5-frame jitter margin that dedup strips.

The original design entered each non-final window mid-way with the *carried*
decoder state so the overlap was not re-emitted. That entry is not safe
anywhere, and the failures are silent:

- **Blank-out after a sentence-final token.** The carried state, having
  already consumed the overlap, re-walks it and — typically right after a
  `.` — emits blanks at 0.98 confidence across the rest of the window. On a
  real recording at a 7 s chunk, window 2 emitted `s.` and then nothing for
  10 s of clear speech (`can you do me a favor and validate your findings
  with codex` lost); at 6 s and 8 s different spans of the same clip went
  missing. The short final flush window showed the same pathology first
  (#855, PR #861), and the fresh-state re-decode fixed it there (#895);
  entering *after* the overlap with the carried state instead of re-walking
  it does not help — the blank-out follows the next `.` just the same.
- **Re-segmented overlap duplicates.** When the re-walk did not stall, it
  re-emitted the overlap with a different segmentation that ID-based dedup
  cannot match (`environment.` → `air environment`), so both survived.

Two rules make the fresh-state re-decode safe:

- **Fresh decoder state.** Re-walking the overlap with the carried state is
  the failure above; a fresh state has the previous right context plus this
  window's left context (4 s) to re-establish itself before the cutoff.
- **Suppression, not dedup, handles the overlap.** A token-dense overlap can
  exceed dedup's bounded search; suppressing at the source keeps dedup's job
  to the jitter margin. For that reason the re-decode path also passes dedup a
  tolerance of twice the jitter margin (10 frames) instead of the legacy 2 s:
  with 2 s, a word repeated within 2 s of the seam (`the old code and the net
  new code`) matched its earlier copy and the bounded substring matcher chopped
  the whole re-decoded prefix.

**Seam reconciliation (#897).** The previous window's last word may be a
fragment cut by the window edge (`and an` for `and analyzing`), which dedup
can never repair: the fragment never equals the full word, a re-emitted single
token is below the substring matcher's two-token minimum, and a punctuation
token the decoder attaches at its emission start blocks the suffix–prefix
match. So the cutoff anchors at the previous window's *last word start*
(`lastWordStartFrame`), the window re-decodes that word in full, and
`AsrManager.reconcileFinalWindowSeam` retires the previous last word from the
accumulated tokens and text (`droppedPreviousTokens`) while stripping the
re-decode's seam artifacts: punctuation emitted at or before that word's
frame, and tokens duplicating a kept previous token inside the jitter region.
Clip 03 of the fixtures pins it: `code and an, and analyzing` → `code and
analyzing`, matching batch.

Two refinements the end-aligned window made necessary: the re-decode can
re-emit the word *before* the previous last word inside the jitter margin, so
re-emitted earlier words are consumed as whole words before the retire
decision; and the re-decode's copy of the last word can drift past the margin
(`out`@247 re-emitted at 253), so the same-word test compares word starts
within the duplicate tolerance. A genuine fast repetition inside that
tolerance (`go go again`) is told apart by evidence: the decoder reports the
tokens it consumed but suppressed before the cutoff, and when the previous
word is among them at its own frame, the visible copy is a second word and
stays. With vocabulary boosting the transcript text may hold a replacement
for the retired word rather than its raw token text, so the manager tracks
the rendered form of each window's last word and retires that.

**End-aligned final window.** A short final flush window (a 16.9 s clip at
an 8 s chunk leaves 0.9 s of new audio behind 2 s of left context) yields
nothing from a fresh state, dropping the last words — the dominant remaining
loss on long LibriSpeech files. The final window is therefore end-aligned to
span a full chunk plus the left context (`finalWindowStart`), the sample
buffer keeps that much audio behind the next window center, and the re-decode
cutoff suppresses what previous windows already emitted, as the batch path
does since #747.

(three real recordings, cleared for release by the speaker), exercised by
`SlidingWindowFinalWindowRegressionTests` whenever the v3 models are cached.

## Empty-Window Recovery (issue #909)

Parakeet TDT v3 has input cuts on which it emits nothing: the joint predicts
blank at every frame from a fresh state, for 11–13 s of clear read speech.
It reproduces in batch on the exact span (`121-123859-0002` 0–13.0 s empty,
0–12.9 s and 0–14.0 s correct), flips with tenths of a second of length, and
the fp16 MLX port of the same checkpoint blanks on the same cuts — so this is
the model, not CoreML quantization. The output is on a knife edge with
respect to the length inputs: the mel normalization moves by about 1 %
between a 12 s and a 13 s input, and that is enough to flip the whole
sequence.

`AsrManager.executeMLInferenceWithTimings` (every decode path: single-shot,
batch chunks, streaming windows) therefore recovers an empty decode of a
window that carries speech (≥ 2 s, RMS ≥ −50 dBFS) by re-running with a
different length declaration, from a copy of the decoder state the first
attempt started from, and keeps the first non-empty result:

1. `.encoderFull` — `mel_length` set to the padded frame count, so the
   encoder treats the zero padding as valid audio (the decoder still stops
   at the real frames);
2. `.preprocessorFull` — `audio_length` set to the padded length, which
   also changes the mel normalization;
3. `.trimmedTail` — the audio declared 0.2 s shorter; the last resort, at
   the price of the final 0.2 s, which the next window's overlap covers
   everywhere but at the very end of the stream.

Each policy flips cuts the others do not; the ladder recovers ten of the
eleven reproduced spans. A good window is never touched: the ladder runs
only when the first decode produced nothing at all — not even tokens
suppressed before a streaming re-decode cutoff, which mean the window
decoded fine and its new audio was silent — at the cost of one extra
preprocessor + encoder + decoder pass per step. The energy gate is a
non-silence test, not a speech test, so a recovered hypothesis replaces the
empty decode only when it is credible (at least two tokens at a mean
confidence of 0.7; genuine recoveries score about 0.9). Every suspicious
window gets the whole ladder: a reduced ladder would lose for good a
one-off cut that only a later policy flips (the next window's overlap
covers only part of it, and single-shot decoding has no later chance), and
nothing cheaper than the model itself tells speech from music or noise
here. Music and noise decode to nothing on every window and pass the
energy gate, so non-speech audio pays the full ladder per window. Measured
on 30 s of MUSAN music on an M5 Pro, net of model load: batch 0.0 s → 0.5 s,
streaming at the default chunk 0.4 s → 1.0 s — still tens of times faster
than real time.
The recovery is enabled for `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3`, the model it was
demonstrated on.

## Post-Merge Repair Pass

Every fix in the earlier sections operates on tokens that *exist* in at
least one chunk's stream. One failure class survives all of them because
the dropped content never decodes into either chunk: the decoder itself
emits blank for audible speech at a seam. It leaves no error and high
confidence — the transcript simply has a hole. After the merge,
`ChunkProcessor` re-decodes the suspect audio with a fresh window in which
the seam does not exist (issue #758).

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ASRConfig.seamGapRepair` | `true` | Gates the pass. CLI: `--no-seam-gap-repair` for A/B measurement. |
| `ASRConfig.seamGapRepairMinGapSeconds` | `1.5` (clamped to `>= 0.5`) | Minimum inter-token gap worth probing. |

The pass runs only for multi-chunk files (`chunkCount > 1`); a
single-window clip is never repaired.

### Seam-Gap Repair (issue #758, PR #761)

The merger can deterministically drop multi-second spans of clearly audible
speech at a seam when the overlap region is low-SNR (crosstalk, applause,
soft speech). Which seams fail depends on decoder state and shifts with
model recompilation — the same file drops *different* spans after an
e5rt/ANE recompile — so no chunk-layout or config change fixes the class
(`melChunkContext` relocates the failures rather than eliminating them).

`repairSeamGaps` walks inter-token gaps longer than the threshold whose
audio carries speech-level energy and re-decodes each with a single fresh
window:

- **Placement matters.** A window centred on the gap can blank the same way
  the original chunk did, because it replays the same pre-gap noise
  history. The probe window starts **at the gap** — the decoder cold-starts
  directly on the dropped speech — with a gap-centred placement as
  fallback; each placement recovers spans the other misses.
- Only tokens strictly inside the gap are spliced in (`spliceCandidate`),
  starting at a word-initial piece (same rule as the seam merge, #683),
  with punctuation-aware, case-insensitive edge dedupe against the words
  bordering the gap. The probe can re-hear a bordering word at a slightly
  shifted frame, sometimes re-capitalized ("▁for" vs "▁For") — the merged
  stream's copy is kept. The dedupe tolerance is deliberately tight
  (6 frames = 0.48 s): genuine stutters ("I I") re-heard by the probe sit
  at or beyond it.
- The scan iterates (max 3 rounds) so a partial recovery's residual gap
  gets its own probe; a probed-gap memo prevents re-probing silent pauses
  and a 32-probe budget (`maxSeamGapRepairs`) bounds pathological inputs
  (hours of intermittent noise). A half-hour conference recording with
  applause breaks legitimately probes ~12 gaps, and residual-gap iteration
  needs headroom beyond that — hence 32.
- Genuine silence yields no in-gap tokens by construction and is left
  untouched.

### Adaptive Speech-Energy Gate

The pass gates probes on a per-frame RMS speech test
(`speechLikeSeconds`). The original gate was a fixed threshold (0.008),
which is structurally dead for quiet recordings: the #747 reproducer peaks
below 2% FS with tail-speech RMS around 0.001–0.003 — a gate tuned on
normal levels can never fire on quiet gaps. The threshold adapts
to the recording's own level:

```
threshold = min(0.008, max(0.0005, p75FrameRms × 0.3))
```

where `p75FrameRms` is the 75th-percentile per-frame RMS over the whole
file (robust to long pauses dominating the median), computed once per
transcription. Frames of exact digital silence are excluded from the
percentile: an all-zero frame is *no recording* (muted spans, inserted
gaps — real capture always carries dither/room tone), and counting them
drags the percentile to zero on silence-heavy files, collapsing the gate
to its floor. Quiet-but-nonzero frames stay in — excluding them would need
a silence threshold, which is the very thing being derived. A fully
digital-silent file falls back to the ceiling. Normal-level speech
clamps to the previous 0.008 ceiling — behavior there is unchanged — while
quiet recordings scale down to a floor that still excludes dither and
digital silence. A room-tone-only gap can trigger a probe that
recovers nothing; the cost is one wasted window decode and the stream is
unchanged.

The constants live on `ChunkProcessor` (`speechRms*`):

| Constant | Value | ≈ dBFS | Why this value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `speechRmsCeiling` | `0.008` | −42 | The pre-adaptive fixed gate, tuned on normal-level recordings. Clamping to it keeps every file loud enough to reach it byte-identical to the pre-#747 behavior (verified: 20-file LibriSpeech test-clean matches stock). The adaptive terms can only *lower* the bar, never raise it. |
| `speechRmsReferenceScale` | `0.3` | −10.5 below reference | Speech's internal dynamic range: trailing syllables, fricatives, and sentence-final decay sit ~6–12 dB below the voiced-vowel level the reference lands on, while noise floors sit 20–40 dB below it. 0.3 parks the gate in the valley between the two — low enough to admit a fading last word, high enough that room tone never passes. |
| `speechRmsFloor` | `0.0005` | −66 | Bounds the mostly-silence failure mode where the percentile itself lands on noise and `reference × scale` collapses toward zero. Sits above 16-bit dither/quantization (RMS ~1e-5–1e-4) and quiet room tone (< 3e-4), and below the quietest validated speech (#747 reproducer tail, RMS ≈ 0.001 — 2× headroom, the tightest margin in the formula). |
| `speechRmsReferencePercentile` | `0.75` | — | p50 lands on silence whenever pauses fill over half the file; p90+ converges on the max and is skewed by plosives, clicks, and clipping. p75 is the highest transient-robust percentile, assuming speech fills ≥ 25 % of the *recorded* (non-digital-zero) frames. |

None of these were swept over a corpus; they are dB-scale engineering
estimates validated by regression (reproducer recovers byte-exact,
normal-level corpus unchanged, clamp boundaries pinned by unit tests). The
design bet is that the clamp structure makes a wrong constant fail
*conservative*: the worst case is the repair not firing (pre-#747
behavior), never a new false positive on audio that already worked.
Crossover for reference: a file clamps to the ceiling once its p75 frame
RMS exceeds `0.008 / 0.3 ≈ 0.027`.

### Cost and Known Limitations

- Probes are extra window decodes: ~25–30 on a 30-minute applause-heavy
  conference file (~20% over baseline), near zero on clean audio.
- Seam **garbles** ("language in" → "languag ines") leave no token gap and
  are invisible to the pass — they need a fix in the merger itself. The
  *order-inversion* subclass of this (subwords/words reordered across a seam,
  issue #825) is fixed in the merger by keeping token order authoritative
  instead of re-sorting by timestamp (PR #830, see "Token Order Is
  Authoritative"). Garbles from the two windows tokenizing the same audio
  *differently* at the splice are a separate, still-open case.
- Edge re-hearings with different tokenization can occasionally duplicate a
  boundary word (~1 per 15–20 min of dense conference speech) — the same
  artifact class and rate the merger already produces. Deliberately not
  deduped harder: genuine stutters sit at the same time separations, so a
  wider net would delete real speech.
- The adaptive gate's reference level is whole-file: a loud-body recording
  with a quiet gap clamps to the ceiling, so that gap is gated as if the
  whole file were loud. A gap-local reference window would close this.
- The dead-silence-at-window-end pathology also afflicts **mid-file**
  windows on the mel-context path (issue #803; observed: a LibriVox
  recording whose quiet outro credit falls in such a window loses it).
  Snapping window ends to the last speech-bearing frame was tried twice and
  reverted both times — the failing window decodes all-blank even when
  trimmed and backfilled to end in speech, because the trigger is
  fixed-stride window *starts* landing mid-word on quiet speech, not the
  trailing silence. The v3 no-mel path's silence-aligned starts avoid the
  class (validated on the LibriVox case), which is why v3 now defaults to
  no-mel; the mel-context path retains the limitation.
- Repair validation corpora are English conference and quiet dictation
  audio; multilingual and music-heavy content is less exercised.

## Streaming Threshold for Large Files

`ASRConfig` also exposes two knobs that are not about chunk boundary quality
but about memory pressure on very long files:

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ASRConfig.streamingEnabled` | `true` | When `true`, files larger than `streamingThreshold` are read incrementally from disk by the chunked path instead of being loaded entirely into memory. |
| `ASRConfig.streamingThreshold` | `480_000` samples (≈ 30 s at 16 kHz) | Threshold above which `streamingEnabled` actually kicks in. Below this, the file is held in a single `[Float]` buffer. |

This pair affects which `AudioSampleSource` `ChunkProcessor` is constructed
with; it does not change chunk geometry or boundary search. For files
significantly longer than the threshold (an hour of audio is ≈ 57.6 M
samples) the streaming path is the difference between a few hundred MiB of
peak resident memory and a few hundred KiB. Both knobs are orthogonal to
`parallelChunkConcurrency` — worker pool size is bounded independently — but
the worker pool's clones each hold their own short-lived decoder/encoder
buffers, so for the most memory-constrained environments setting
`parallelChunkConcurrency = 1` and leaving streaming enabled is the lowest
high-water-mark configuration.

## Validation Strategy

A long-transcription change should be checked with a fixed matrix, not only with
one successful clip. The matrix should include:

- issue-specific canaries that previously reproduced boundary drops or drift
- long single-language recordings with source text
- long multilingual recordings across several languages
- intentional mixed-language recordings where the real switch must remain
- short public benchmarks such as FLEURS to catch broad multilingual regressions

For each fixture, keep the transcript and compare it against the source text or
the best known baseline. The review should answer concrete questions:

- Did any word or clause disappear?
- Did the seam introduce a wrong-language phrase?
- Did a mixed-language switch remain at the right place?
- Did overlap merging duplicate or truncate words?
- Did punctuation move enough to make the sentence boundary wrong?

When adding a new fixture, record the language, approximate duration, reference
source, and the specific failure it is meant to catch. This makes future changes
auditable instead of relying on memory of why a clip was added.

### Seam Canary (required for boundary or merge changes)

Any change to `ChunkProcessor`'s boundary search or overlap merge must be
A/B'd against the baseline build on a seam-dense fixture before merging.
Short-clip WER is not a substitute: the issue #683 fix repaired six seam
artifacts in one hour of earnings audio while remaining exactly WER-neutral
on FLEURS — a merge bug can be invisible to the aggregate metric and still
make transcripts unusable.

The procedure:

1. Transcribe a long fixture with both builds. The cached
   `earnings22-1h/earnings22_top4_1h.wav` (~1 h, ~277 seams) is the standard
   choice; `swift run fluidaudiocli transcribe <file>` on each build.
2. Word-diff the two transcripts (`diff <(tr ' ' '\n' < a.txt) <(tr ' ' '\n'
   < b.txt)`). Inspect every diff individually — each one must be
   explainable as an intended repair. Do not accept a net count.
3. Scan both outputs for mechanical seam artifacts that need no reference
   transcript: mid-word punctuation (`grep -oE '[a-z],[a-z]+'`), and any
   diff hunk that concatenates two previously separate words.

### Invariants Must Be Executable

The history of this path is a caution: the overlap merge ladder shipped in
PR #177 (2025-11) and its first token-stream tests arrived with PR #604
(2026-05); issue #683's glued-word class survived that entire gap. The
failure mode was even listed in this document while the Overlap Merge
section asserted the matcher was safe — the claim was about the wrong
layer, and nothing executable connected the two.

The rules that follow from that:

- A safety claim about the merge belongs in a test, not (only) in this
  document. If a sentence here says the merger "cannot" do something,
  there must be a unit test that fails when it does.
- Merge unit tests must drive realistic token streams *with* a splice-safe
  vocabulary set (`mergeTokenWindowsForTesting(left:right:spliceSafeTokenIds:)`).
  Bare integer token IDs are structurally blind to word-level artifacts —
  that blindness is exactly why #683 was untestable before PR #688.
- Every seam-affecting invariant the code enforces today is listed here;
  keep this list in sync when adding one:
  - a splice from the right window never starts mid-word
    (`spliceSafeTokenIds` gating, issue #683)
  - the midpoint cutoff never strands a word's continuation pieces on the
    wrong side of the seam (`mergeByMidpoint`, issue #683)
  - a seam never *deletes* real content when no splice-safe token exists —
    the fallbacks glue rather than drop (PR #759)
  - chunk starts are always frame-aligned (`chunkLayout`)
  - at least 6 encoder frames of seam overlap are preserved
    (`silenceAlignedChunkStarts`)
  - the repair pass only ever *extends* the token stream inside a probed
    gap; it never rewrites existing tokens
    (`spliceCandidate` filtering, issue #758)
  - genuine silence yields no spliced tokens — probe placement plus in-gap
    filtering, exercised by `SeamGapRepairTests`
  - the final window is never zero-pad-dominated: a short last chunk
    backfills with real audio decoded as a suppressed prefix
    (`lastChunkWarmupSamples`, issue #747)

## How This Path Evolved

The long-form batch path accreted through a specific sequence of failures.
The commit history (`git log --follow -- …/TDT/ChunkProcessor.swift`) is the
authoritative record; the milestones:

| When | Change | Failure it addressed |
|---|---|---|
| 2025-08 (#77, #83) | v3 support; first overlap dedupe at chunk borders | duplicated words at seams. #83's PR text already flags the final chunk "may not have enough context and gets transcribed as blank" — the earliest sighting of what became #747, fixed eleven months later. |
| 2025-11 (#177) | Stateless per-chunk decoding; overlap merge ladder | decoder state corruption across chunks; enabled batching (and later parallelism). First merge token-stream tests only arrived with #604 (2026-05) — see the caution above. |
| 2025-12 (#212 → #223) | Frame-aligned 14.96 s chunks | integer-division remainder silently skipped audio between chunks on long files. |
| 2026-01 (#257) | Disk-backed streaming reads | memory blowup on hour-scale files. |
| 2026-01 (#264) | 80 ms mel-context prepend | non-first chunks decoding blank for their first frames (encoder convolutions lacked left context). |
| 2026-04 (#507) | Parallel chunk workers | wall-clock; required the statelessness from #177 — an earlier persistent-state fix (`eb9c19f7`) had to be abandoned for it. |
| 2026-04/05 (#594 → #604) | v3 no-mel path, silence-aligned boundaries, dual-decode arbitration | the #264 prepend shifting v3's first-frame distribution into English-prior drift at seams. |
| 2026-06 (#683 → #688) | Word-boundary-safe splices (`spliceSafeTokenIds`) | glued/hybrid seam words ("worksks", "ye,ah") from splicing mid-word. |
| 2026-06 (#706 → #708) | Case-folded matching + seam word-duplicate collapse | "…the meeting Meeting was…" false-sentence-start duplicates. |
| 2026-07 (#758 → #761) | Seam-gap repair pass | multi-second speech spans dropped at low-SNR seams — unfixable at the merge layer because the tokens never existed. |
| 2026-07 (#759) | Bound-safe fallbacks in merge repairs | three residual paths that dropped content when no splice-safe token existed. |
| 2026-07 (#747) | End-aligned final window + adaptive speech gate | final-window blank-out on quiet audio — a short last chunk zero-padded to the model window is a degenerate input; fixed structurally by backfilling with real audio. The adaptive gate replaced an absolute energy gate that was structurally dead on the quiet-audio class. |
| 2026-07 (#825 → #830) | Merge order authoritative; clamp timestamps instead of re-sorting | subwords/words reordered across a seam ("im Frühjahr" → "imüh Frjahr", "Für die" → "die Für") — a final global timestamp sort scrambled the order the splice logic had built, because frame timestamps are coarse and don't co-register across a seam. |

Two recurring lessons in that table:

- **Fixes migrate down the stack.** Duplicates and glued words were merge
  bugs; dropped spans were decode bugs the merge could never see. When a
  transcript hole survives a merge-layer fix, suspect the decoder emitted
  blank and reach for a repair-pass-shaped fix instead.
- **Absolute thresholds age badly.** The frame-energy boundary search
  (#604) and the repair speech gate (#747) both started as fixed constants
  and both had to become adaptive (median-relative, p75-relative) the first
  time genuinely quiet or noisy field audio hit them.

## Focused Tests

Unit tests catch chunking and decoder invariants, but they do not replace a
source-backed transcript matrix for long-form quality.

Useful focused checks:

```bash
swift test --filter ChunkProcessorTests
swift test --filter ChunkProcessorSeamResidualTests   # PR #759 drop-path fallbacks
swift test --filter SeamGapRepairTests                # issue #758 gap splice + energy gate
swift test --filter EndAlignedFinalWindowTests        # issue #747 final-window backfill
swift test --filter TdtRefactoredComponentsTests
swift test --filter TdtDecoderV2Tests
swift test --filter ASRConfigTests   # covers parallelChunkConcurrency default, clamping, override
```

`ChunkProcessorTests` includes word-boundary splice tests that pass a
splice-safe token set. When adding merge tests, do the same: a merge test
without one exercises only the token-ID layer and cannot catch glued or
hybrid words (see "Invariants Must Be Executable" above).
