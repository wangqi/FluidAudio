# Text Processing

## Overview

**[text-processing-rs](https://github.com/FluidInference/text-processing-rs)** provides both Inverse Text Normalization (ITN) and Text Normalization (TN) across 7 languages (EN, DE, ES, FR, HI, JA, ZH). 100% NeMo test compatibility (3,011 tests). Rust port of [NVIDIA NeMo Text Processing](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-text-processing) with Swift wrapper.

## Inverse Text Normalization (ITN)

ITN converts spoken-form ASR output to written form — useful for post-processing ASR transcriptions:

| Input (spoken) | Output (written) |
|----------------|------------------|
| "two hundred" | "200" |
| "five dollars and fifty cents" | "$5.50" |
| "january fifth twenty twenty five" | "January 5, 2025" |
| "two thirty pm" | "2:30 p.m." |
| "test at gmail dot com" | "test@gmail.com" |

## Text Normalization (TN)

TN converts written-form text to spoken form — useful for TTS preprocessing:

| Input (written) | Output (spoken) |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "123" | "one hundred twenty three" |
| "$5.50" | "five dollars and fifty cents" |
| "January 5, 2025" | "january fifth twenty twenty five" |
| "2:30 PM" | "two thirty p m" |
| "1st" | "first" |

## Using with FluidAudio

FluidAudio supports text-processing-rs through the `TextNormalizer` class. The native engine ships with the package as the `NemoTextProcessing` binary target and is linked directly — no setup required, it works out of the box for every SwiftPM consumer. Apps that don't use TTS or ITN can opt out of the engine (about 8 MB per architecture slice) with a package trait; see [Opting out](#opting-out-of-the-engine).

### ITN (Spoken to Written)

```swift
import FluidAudio

let normalizer = TextNormalizer.shared

print("ITN version: \(normalizer.version ?? "unknown")")

// Normalize spoken-form text
let result = normalizer.normalize("two hundred dollars")
// Returns "$200"
```

### TN (Written to Spoken)

```swift
// Convert written text to spoken form for TTS
let spoken = normalizer.tnNormalize("$5.50")
// Returns "five dollars and fifty cents"

let spoken = normalizer.tnNormalize("January 5, 2025")
// Returns "january fifth twenty twenty five"
```

### With ASR Results

```swift
// Transcribe audio
let asrResult = try await asrManager.transcribe(samples, source: .system)

// Normalize the result (ITN: spoken → written)
let normalizedResult = normalizer.normalize(result: asrResult)
print(normalizedResult.text)  // Written form
```

### Native Library

The engine is bundled: `Package.swift` declares a `NemoTextProcessing` binary target (a prebuilt xcframework from [text-processing-rs](https://github.com/FluidInference/text-processing-rs) releases) that SwiftPM downloads and links automatically. It is linked at build time, so `TextNormalizer.isNativeAvailable` is a compile-time constant: `true` whenever the engine is part of the build, `false` only when a consumer opts out (below). Releases ≤ 0.15.6 resolved the library at runtime and silently returned input unchanged when it was absent.

### Opting out of the engine

The engine is a prebuilt Rust static library (about 8 MB per architecture slice once linked and stripped, measured on `fluidaudiocli`; the xcframework itself is ~29 MB per iOS slice). ASR/VAD/diarization-only apps, and apps that ship their own Rust runtime (a second copy of the Rust std symbols fails to link), can leave it out with the `NemoTextProcessing` package trait. Requires Swift 6.2 / Xcode 26 or later; older toolchains read `Package.swift` and always link the engine. (SwiftPM 6.1 in Xcode 16.3–16.4 accepts `traits: []` but still links the binary target, so it gives no size benefit there.)

```swift
// Package.swift of the consuming package / app
.package(url: "https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio.git", from: "0.15.7", traits: [])
```

With the trait disabled:

- `TextNormalizer` and `NemoTextNormalizer` remain in the API. `isNativeAvailable`, `isTnAvailable`, and `NemoTextNormalizer.isAvailable` report `false`.
- Every normalization call returns its input unchanged; `version` is `nil`; custom rules are ignored (a warning is logged).
- TTS frontends run without NeMo normalization: Kokoro English falls back to the built-in `EnglishTextNormalizer` rules, and Kokoro Mandarin verbalizes numerals with `MandarinNumberNormalizer`. Keep the trait enabled for byte-exact NeMo readings.

**Xcode projects.** Xcode 26.3 has no UI or pbxproj key for package traits (support appears in 26.4). Until then, wrap the dependency in a one-target local package that sets the trait and re-exports the module, and link the app against that instead of FluidAudio directly:

```swift
// FluidAudioShim/Package.swift
// swift-tools-version: 6.2
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "FluidAudioShim",
    platforms: [.macOS(.v14), .iOS(.v17)],
    products: [.library(name: "FluidAudioShim", targets: ["FluidAudioShim"])],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio.git", from: "0.15.7", traits: [])
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "FluidAudioShim", dependencies: [.product(name: "FluidAudio", package: "FluidAudio")])
    ]
)
```

```swift
// FluidAudioShim/Sources/FluidAudioShim/Reexport.swift
@_exported import FluidAudio
```

Existing `import FluidAudio` lines keep compiling. Measured on a universal macOS app this way (Xcode 26.3): 16.85 MB off the executable, 12.7%, zero engine symbols, ASR/diarization symbols unchanged.

**The xcframework still downloads.** The binary target is declared unconditionally and only the dependency edge is trait-conditioned, so a clean resolve still fetches the 49 MB `NemoTextProcessing.xcframework.zip` even with the trait off. Ship size is unaffected; CI and cold checkouts pay the download. That is a SwiftPM limitation, not something the package can change.

To build the package itself without the engine: `swift build --disable-default-traits`.
