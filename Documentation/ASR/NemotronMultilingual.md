### How it differs from English-only Nemotron

The multilingual variant adds:

1. **`prompt_id` int32 input** on the encoder — selects the language hint embedding. Pass a language code like `"en-US"` or `"auto"` (the model's default-prompt id).
2. **Leading `<xx-XX>` language-tag token** — emitted as the first decoder output, then filtered from the transcript and surfaced via `detectedLanguage()`.
3. **Larger vocab** (13,087 tokens vs ~1k) and a smaller channel cache `[1, 24, 56, 1024]` for `att_context_size=[56, 0]`.

## Model Distribution

The multilingual model is **local-path-only** at the moment — no HuggingFace repo yet. Convert it yourself via `mobius/models/stt/nemotron-asr-streaming-multilingual-0.6b/coreml/conversion_scripts/convert_nemotron_multilingual.py` (Linux + CUDA required), then quantize with `quantize_int8.py`. The resulting `build_int8_<NNN>ms/` directory contains:

```
build_int8_1120ms/
├── preprocessor.mlmodelc   (or .mlpackage before compilation)
├── encoder.mlmodelc
├── decoder.mlmodelc
├── joint.mlmodelc
├── metadata.json
└── tokenizer.json
```

`StreamingNemotronMultilingualAsrManager` accepts either compiled `.mlmodelc` or raw `.mlpackage` — compiled is preferred when both are present.

## CLI Usage

### Transcribe a file

```bash
swift run fluidaudiocli nemotron-multilingual-transcribe \
    --model-dir /path/to/build_int8_1120ms \
    --language fr-FR \
    --input speech.wav
```

`--language` accepts any FLEURS-style code (`en-US`, `fr-FR`, `de-DE`, `es-ES`, `it-IT`, `pt-BR`, `ja-JP`, …) or `auto` to let the model pick. `--prompt-id <int>` overrides the language with a raw embedding index if you've inspected the `prompt_dictionary` in `metadata.json`.

### FLEURS benchmark

```bash
swift run fluidaudiocli nemotron-multilingual-benchmark \
    --model-dir /path/to/build_int8_1120ms \
    --languages en_us,fr_fr,de_de,es_419,ja_jp,it_it,pt_br \
    --samples all \
    --output /tmp/nemotron_fleurs.json
```

`--samples N` runs the first N alphabetical samples per language; `--samples all` runs the full FLEURS test split. Default dataset repo is `FluidInference/fleurs-full`, override with `--dataset-repo` and the local layout with `--cache-dir`.

> **Note on `FluidInference/fleurs-full`**: at the time of writing this dataset caps fr_fr / de_de / es_419 at 350 utterances each (vs 676 / 862 / 908 in the official `google/fleurs` test split). For published-leaderboard parity, extract `google/fleurs` test arrows yourself.

## Programmatic Usage

```swift
import FluidAudio

let manager = StreamingNemotronMultilingualAsrManager()
try await manager.loadModels(from: URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/build_int8_1120ms"))

await manager.setLanguage("fr-FR")   // or .setPromptId(12)

let partial = try await manager.process(audioBuffer: samples)  // [Float] @ 16 kHz mono
let final = try await manager.finish()

let detected = await manager.detectedLanguage()   // e.g. "fr-FR"
await manager.reset()
```

### Custom vocabulary (hotword biasing)

The Nemotron exports ship no CTC head, so the sliding-window path's CTC
rescorer does not apply here. Instead the manager biases inside the greedy
RNN-T decode: tokens that extend a partially matched vocabulary term get a
flat log-prob bonus at every emission step (decode-time shallow fusion, issue
#841).

```swift
await manager.setCustomVocabulary([
    CustomVocabularyTerm(text: "Torvane"),
    CustomVocabularyTerm(text: "Quexal", aliases: ["Kwexal"]),
])
// Pass [] to disable. Survives reset(); may be set before loadModels().
```

Semantics and limits:

- **Weight scale.** `weight` here is a *per-token logit bonus* (default 4.5,
  the measured recall peak), not the CTC rescoring weight. Values above 6.0
  are treated as legacy CTC-scale weights and fall back to the 4.5 default —
  the simple text-list loader's blanket `weight: 10.0` would otherwise
  over-bias (measured artifacts: word splits like "build today" → "build to
  day"). Most terms should omit `weight`; explicit values in (0, 6.0] are
  honored.
- **Assets.** Biasing needs a logits-producing step decoder
  (`decoder_joint_noencproj` or `decoder_joint`). When a vocabulary is
  active the fused-argmax `decoder_joint_argmax` asset is bypassed in favor
  of a logits path; if the load-time tier priority skipped `decoder_joint`,
  it is loaded lazily from the model directory when the vocabulary is set.
  Only if no logits decoder exists at all is the vocabulary rejected, with
  an error log rather than silent half-application.
- **Greedy decode.** Once a boosted token wins the argmax it is committed —
  there is no beam to undo an over-fire. Keep vocabularies to genuinely
  rare terms; a term the model hears as a word it already spells
  ("Pheynix" → "Phoenix") needs an alias, not more weight.
- **Chunk boundaries are not a barrier.** Unlike the sliding-window CTC
  path, the decoder state and the term match state persist across chunks
  (only `reset()`/`finish()` clear them), so a term whose audio spans a
  boundary keeps its bias. Verified by a boundary-phase sweep: stepping
  leading silence through a full 2240 ms chunk period, term recovery holds
  at every phase. Multi-word terms are still harder — more greedy steps
  must go right — but not because of chunking.
- Terms shorter than 3 letters are skipped (2 for CJK); word-start anchoring
  keeps "ran" from matching into "CRAN". CJK terms match unanchored.
- **False-fire profile** (LibriSpeech test-clean spot check, 40 invented
  distractor terms): confidently decoded speech is untouched, but an
  acoustically uncertain rare-name region can be captured by a distractor
  that shares the true audio's opening letters. Keep vocabularies small and
  relevant; do not feed speculative or screen-harvested term lists.

`FLUIDAUDIO_BIAS_LOG=1` traces every boosted flip on stderr for weight
tuning and over-fire attribution.

## Benchmark Results

Apple M2, FLEURS test set, int8 encoder, `MLComputeUnits.cpuAndNeuralEngine`.

### Normalizer

Scoring follows the [HF Open ASR Leaderboard](https://github.com/huggingface/open_asr_leaderboard) convention used by NVIDIA in the Canary/Parakeet-v3 paper:

- **English** → `EnglishTextNormalizer` (whisper-normalizer 0.1.12 equivalent: contraction expansion, British→American, number folding, abbreviation expansion). Our `TextNormalizer.normalize()`.
- **Non-English Latin** (fr, de, es, it, pt, …) → `BasicTextNormalizer(remove_diacritics=False)` plus an inverse text normalization (ITN) pass: digit runs in the reference are spelled out via `NumberFormatter.spellOut` for the language's locale before WER computation. Required because the model emits "mille neuf cent soixante-seize" while FLEURS keeps "1976" in the reference. Thousands separators handled across all five Unicode space variants FLEURS actually uses (U+0020/00A0/2007/2009/202F). Our `TextNormalizer.basicNormalize(_, spellOutLocale:)`.
- **CJK** (ja, ko, zh, th) → character-level edit rate after whitespace stripping (segmentation-free). Reported in the "WER" column by community convention.

### Chunk size sweep (FLEURS full test split)

Re-measured 2026-06-28 with the **native-Swift mel front-end** (`NemotronMelExtractor`;
no CoreML preprocessor — see issue #739) over the full `google/fleurs` test splits. All
builds use `att_context_size=[56,0]`; they differ only in `chunk_mel_frames` → processing
chunk size. The shipped tiers are now **560 / 1120 / 2240 ms** (the earlier 320 ms tier was
dropped, 2240 ms added). The per-language vocab-pruned ship and the full multilingual ship
score identically (en_us @ 2240 ms = 8.72 % on both), so the table uses the full ship.

| Language | 560 ms | 1120 ms | 2240 ms | NVIDIA ([56,0]) | n   |
|----------|-------:|--------:|--------:|----------------:|----:|
| en_us    |  9.05  |   8.73  |   8.72  |         11.35   | 647 |
| fr_fr    |  9.80  |   9.44  |   9.36  |         13.44   | 676 |
| de_de    | 10.61  |  10.01  |   9.96  |           —     | 862 |
| es_419   |  4.85  |   4.75  |   4.73  |          8.69   | 908 |
| ja_jp    | 14.27  |  13.79  |  13.78  |           —     | 650 |
| it_it    |  5.40  |   5.43  |   5.39  |          7.33   | 865 |
| pt_br    |  6.38  |   6.16  |   6.19  |          8.99   | 919 |
| **AVG**  |**8.62**|**8.33** |**8.30** |                 |     |
| agg RTFx | 40.5x  | 66.0x   |  73.1x  |                 |     |

WER% for spaced scripts, CER% for ja_jp (segmentation-free, whitespace-stripped). Same
normalizer pipeline as the row above (HF Open-ASR-Leaderboard convention). Aggregate RTFx
is total audio ÷ total processing across all 7 languages, end-to-end single-stream on Apple
Silicon (machine/load-dependent — treat the relative ordering, not the absolute, as meaningful).

**Accuracy improves monotonically with chunk size** and meets-or-beats NVIDIA's published
`[56,0]` numbers on all five published languages (at 2240 ms: en −2.6, fr −4.1, es −4.0,
it −1.9, pt −2.8 pp). These numbers are ~2–4 pp better than the prior version of this table;
the gain comes from model / decode-path / normalizer updates since it was written — **not**
the Swift mel port, which is numerically parity to the removed CoreML preprocessor
(max |Δ| ≈ 9e-3 vs NeMo PyTorch, confirmed at conversion time). Cross-comparison to NVIDIA is
sensitive to normalization and should be read as indicative.

Reproduce (one run per tier):

```bash
swift run -c release fluidaudiocli nemotron-multilingual-benchmark \
    --model-dir <multilingual ship dir> \
    --languages en_us,fr_fr,de_de,es_419,ja_jp,it_it,pt_br \
    --samples all --chunk-ms <560|1120|2240> --output results.json
```

### Caveats

- **`MLComputeUnits` matters a lot.** Default `.all` routes the int8 encoder to GPU and runs ~10× slower than ANE. The manager pins `.cpuAndNeuralEngine` automatically; do not override unless you have a reason.
- **int8 vs fp16 is a wash.** Average WER is identical at all three chunk sizes; per-language drift is within ±1 pp. Ship int8 for the 50% size win and ANE residency.
- **Two independent latency axes.** NVIDIA's published modes (`att_context_size = [56,0] / [56,3] / [56,6] / [56,13]` → ~80 / 320 / 560 / 1120 ms architectural lookahead) control right-context inside the encoder. Our `560 / 1120 / 2240 ms` build labels refer to `chunk_mel_frames` (processing chunk size), not lookahead. All FluidAudio builds currently ship `[56,0]` (no lookahead).
- **CJK languages** use character-level edit rate as the "WER" field by convention; whitespace tokenization is meaningless for ja/ko/zh/th.
- **Punctuation density drops at small chunk sizes** ([#687](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio/issues/687)). On long continuous speech the 560 ms build starts punctuating normally, then commas/periods become increasingly sparse as the session continues; 1120 ms and 2240 ms retain noticeably more punctuation on the same audio, and a session reset restores it. The words themselves are unaffected (WER-neutral) — only punctuation marks thin out. Cause is model-side: shorter chunks give the encoder less right context at sentence boundaries than the published builds' `att_context_size` assumes, and greedy RNN-T decoding compounds the miss over the session. If punctuation matters for your use case, ship 1120 ms or larger, or segment long streams (e.g. reset on VAD silence).
