# Qwen3-ASR

> **Beta**
>
> This implementation is under active development. Accuracy (WER/CER) may be worse than the original PyTorch model due to CoreML limitations. See [Benchmarks.md](Benchmarks.md#qwen3-asr-beta--in-progress) for full FLEURS results across all 30 languages.

Encoder-decoder automatic speech recognition using [Qwen3-ASR-0.6B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B) converted to CoreML.

## Model

**CoreML Model**: [FluidInference/qwen3-asr-0.6b-coreml](https://huggingface.co/FluidInference/qwen3-asr-0.6b-coreml)

Both **f32** and **int8** variants use the v2 ANE-optimized audio encoder. See [Model Variants](#model-variants) for RAM/speed tradeoffs and [Why not int8?](#why-not-int8) for decoder quantization details.

## Architecture

Qwen3-ASR uses an encoder-decoder architecture with autoregressive text generation:

1. **Audio Encoder**: Processes 1-second audio windows (100 mel frames at 10ms hop)
2. **Decoder**: 28-layer transformer with KV-cache for efficient token generation
3. **Generation**: Autoregressive decoding at ~60-80ms per token

## Supported Languages

Qwen3-ASR supports 30 languages with automatic language detection:

| Code | Language | Code | Language | Code | Language |

```

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
# Transcribe a file (auto-detect language)

```

### Swift API

```swift
import FluidAudio

// Initialize manager
let manager = Qwen3AsrManager()

// Load models (auto-downloads if needed)
let modelDir = try await Qwen3AsrModels.download()
try await manager.loadModels(from: modelDir)

// Transcribe audio samples (16kHz mono Float32)
let text = try await manager.transcribe(audioSamples: samples)
```

## Benchmarks

## Files

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `qwen3_asr_audio_encoder_v2.mlmodelc` | Audio feature extraction (ANE-optimized, Conv2d + einsum) |
| `qwen3_asr_decoder_stateful.mlmodelc` | Autoregressive decoder with KV-cache |
| `qwen3_asr_embeddings.bin` | Token embedding weights (float16) |
| `vocab.json` | Tokenizer vocabulary (151,936 tokens) |

The original `qwen3_asr_audio_encoder.mlmodelc` (v1) is still available on HuggingFace for backward compatibility.

## Model Variants

Benchmarked on 10 LibriSpeech test-clean files (~70s total audio), M4 Max:

| Variant | Encoder RAM | Decoder RAM | Embeds RAM | **Total RAM** | Overall RTFx | WER |
|---------|------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| f32 (v2 encoder) | 100 MB | 988 MB | 391 MB | ~1480 MB | 3.1x | 0.7% |
| int8 (v2 encoder) | 100 MB | 330 MB | 296 MB | **728 MB** | 2.8x | 0.7% |

All variants produce identical transcriptions. The v2 encoder reduces encoder RAM from ~400 MB to 100 MB via Conv2d + einsum rewrite with fp16 precision.

### V2 Audio Encoder (ANE-Optimized)

The v2 encoder rewrites the 18 transformer layers for 100% Apple Neural Engine scheduling:

- `nn.Linear` → `nn.Conv2d(kernel_size=1)` for all projections
- Tensor layout changed from `(B, S, C)` to `(B, C, 1, S)`
- Per-head einsum attention (14 heads × 64 channels)
- Manual LayerNorm on channel dimension

**Isolated encoder speedup:** 1.53x on M4 Max (11.61ms → 7.60ms median). End-to-end pipeline improvement is modest since the 28-layer autoregressive decoder dominates total inference time.

Int8 quantization of the v2 encoder was tested: same WER, same RTFx, same RAM (encoder is already small at 100 MB). Only benefit is half the download size (179 MB vs 356 MB on disk).

## CoreML Limitations

This CoreML implementation differs from the original PyTorch in ways that may affect accuracy:

| Feature | Original PyTorch | CoreML |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Attention | Dynamic flash attention (1-8s) | Fixed 1s windows, stateless |
| Decoding | Greedy or beam search | Greedy only |
| Streaming | Native with chunk unfixing | Not implemented |
| Timestamps | Non-autoregressive aligner | Not implemented |
| Max audio | 20 minutes | 30 seconds |
| Batch size | Configurable (up to 32) | Single sample |

**Impact on accuracy:**
- Fixed 1s encoder windows lose cross-window context that dynamic attention provides
- Greedy decoding may miss better paths that beam search would find

## Why not int8?

int8 quantization does not improve performance for Qwen3-ASR on Apple Silicon. In testing, int8 was actually **slower** (1.4x RTFx) than f32 (2.8x RTFx).

**Root cause:** Qwen3-ASR uses a 28-layer transformer decoder that runs **once per token** (autoregressive). Each forward pass requires dequantizing ~1GB of weights across all layers. This overhead multiplies with token count.

This differs from parallel decoders like Parakeet TDT, where:
- The decoder is small (~23MB) and runs once
- int8 dequantization cost is amortized across batch output

For autoregressive LLM-style decoders, fp16 compute precision (used by f32 models internally) provides the best speed/accuracy tradeoff on Apple Silicon.

## Performance by Language

Autoregressive ASR speed varies by language due to differing natural speech rates. Languages spoken faster produce more syllables (and thus tokens) per second of audio, requiring more decoder iterations.

| Language | Speech Rate | Impact on RTFx |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Japanese | 8.03 syl/sec | Slower (more tokens) |
| Spanish | 7.73 syl/sec | |
| English | 6.34 syl/sec | |
| Mandarin | 5.86 syl/sec | Faster (fewer tokens) |
| Cantonese | 5.57 syl/sec | |
| Vietnamese | 5.30 syl/sec | |

*Speech rate data from [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fast-talkers/) and [Science.org](https://www.science.org/content/article/human-speech-may-have-universal-transmission-rate-39-bits-second) based on Dr. François Pellegrino's 2019 research.*

**Why this matters:** Japanese speakers produce ~37% more syllables per second than Mandarin speakers. For autoregressive models like Qwen3-ASR, more syllables = more tokens = more decoder calls = slower inference.
