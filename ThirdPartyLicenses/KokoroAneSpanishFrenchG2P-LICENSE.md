# Spanish / French text frontends (Kokoro ANE `.spanish`, `.french`)

`fr_lexicon_cache.json` and `es_lexicon_cache.json` on
`FluidInference/kokoro-82m-coreml` are generated from word lists in ipa-dict
(https://github.com/open-dict-data/ipa-dict, `fr_FR` and `es_ES`), plus
proper nouns from Misaki's English lexicons. Their pronunciations were
generated with espeak-ng and Misaki's `EspeakG2P` post-processing, the
phonemization Kokoro's Spanish and French voices were trained on. No
espeak-ng code is distributed. The French file keeps ipa-dict's
h aspiré marks. Words missing from the French lexicon go through CharsiuG2P
(https://github.com/lingjzhu/CharsiuG2P, MIT), already shipped as
`MultilingualG2PEncoder/Decoder.mlmodelc`.
